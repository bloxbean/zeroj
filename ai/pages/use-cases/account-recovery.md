# Prove you own a Cardano account

> Prove you know the wallet root key behind a Cardano address, without revealing the seed or signing anything, so a refund can reach the real owner.

Picture a wallet hack in which attackers obtain users' address-level signing keys and drain the
funds. An operator such as an exchange or wallet provider wants to refund the victims. Now it has a
hard problem. The attacker can show up and claim too, and a signature from the leaked keys proves
nothing. The genuine owner still has their 24-word recovery phrase, but handing that to anyone
would be a disaster. And a refund submitted on-chain can be copied from the mempool and redirected.

This page explains why zero knowledge is the tool that resolves this, and what ZeroJ's largest
circuit proves.

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

## Why a signature isn't enough

Cardano wallets derive keys along the CIP-1852 path `m / 1852' / 1815' / account' / role / index`.
The first three steps are **hardened**, the last two are **soft**, and the two kinds behave very
differently:

- **Soft derivation can be run backwards.** A child private key is the parent key plus an offset
  anyone can compute from the parent's extended public key (xpub). One leaked address key plus the
  account xpub, which some wallets keep on their servers, gives up the **account** private key, and
  with it every address in the account.
- **So everything from the address up to the account is potentially compromised.** A signature
  under any of those keys can be produced by the attacker too.
- **Hardened derivation is a one-way wall.** It feeds the parent *private* key into the derivation,
  so the attack can't climb from the account to the **root key**. Only the real owner has that.

The one claim an attacker can't fake is therefore *"I know the root key this address descends
from"*. You can't reveal the root key. And a verifier can't check the root-to-address link from
public data, because the hardened steps need the private key. That combination is exactly what a
zero-knowledge proof handles.

## The zero-knowledge idea

**The owner proves "I know a wallet root key that derives, along the real CIP-1852 path, to this
address's payment key hash, and I authorise a payout to this recipient". Only the key hash and the
recipient are revealed.**

The circuit takes the root extended private key as a secret witness and replays the whole
derivation inside the proof. That means three hardened and two soft BIP32-Ed25519 steps (HMAC-SHA512
plus Ed25519 arithmetic emulated in the BLS12-381 field), the leaf public key and the Blake2b-224
key hash. It then checks that the result equals the public payment key hash.

## What stays private, what's public

| Input | Visibility | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `rootKL`, `rootKR`, `rootChainCode` | Secret | The root extended private key: the wallet's master secret |
| `account`, `role`, `index` | Secret | The derivation path stays private; `pkh` already pins the address |
| `recipientBytes` | Secret witness | Constrained to pack exactly to the public `recipient` |
| `pkh` | Public | The address's payment key hash, already public on-chain |
| `recipient` | Public | The payout's payment key hash, bound so a copied proof can't be redirected |

## How it works

1. **Vouchers.** The operator locks a refund voucher UTxO for each affected account. Its datum
   holds `pkh` and `refundAmount`.
2. **Prove.** The owner runs the desktop app or CLI, enters the recovery phrase at a hidden prompt
   and chooses a recipient address. The seed is used in memory only. It's never written to disk or
   sent anywhere.
3. **Verify.** Anyone can check the proof off-chain in under a second. On-chain, a claim
   transaction spends the voucher.
4. **One claim.** A UTxO can only be spent once, so each voucher pays out once. Anyone, such as a
   fee sponsor, may submit the claim, and the funds still go to the bound recipient.

## The circuit

This is the demo's `OwnershipProof`, unchanged apart from imports and comments:

```java title="OwnershipProof.java"
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.*;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.zk.ZkCip1852;

@ZKCircuit(name = "account-ownership-proof", version = 4)
public class OwnershipProof {

    @Prove
    void prove(ZkContext zk,
               @Secret @FixedSize(32) ZkBytes rootKL,
               @Secret @FixedSize(32) ZkBytes rootKR,
               @Secret @FixedSize(32) ZkBytes rootChainCode,
               @Secret @FixedSize(4) ZkBytes account,
               @Secret @FixedSize(4) ZkBytes role,
               @Secret @FixedSize(4) ZkBytes index,
               @Secret @FixedSize(28) ZkBytes recipientBytes,
               @Public ZkField pkh,
               @Public ZkField recipient) {
        // Root key + full CIP-1852 path -> 28-byte payment key hash, pinned to the public pkh
        ZkBytes derived = ZkCip1852.paymentKeyHash(zk, rootKL, rootKR, rootChainCode, account, role, index);
        pack(zk, derived).assertEqual(pkh);
        // Bind the payout: the proof commits to the recipient's packed key hash
        pack(zk, recipientBytes).assertEqual(recipient);
    }

    // Big-endian packing of a 28-byte hash into one field element (Horner's rule)
    private static ZkField pack(ZkContext zk, ZkBytes bytes) {
        ZkField acc = bytes.get(0).asField();
        for (int i = 1; i < bytes.size(); i++) {
            acc = acc.mul(zk.constant(256L)).add(bytes.get(i).asField());
        }
        return acc;
    }
}
```

The file is short, but the circuit behind it is large. `ZkCip1852.paymentKeyHash` composes ZeroJ's
in-circuit Blake2b, SHA-512, HMAC-SHA512, Ed25519 and BIP32 gadgets. The composed derivation is
validated byte-for-byte against Cardano Client Lib's HD-wallet derivation. Packing each 28-byte
hash into one field element keeps the proof at **two** public inputs, which is what makes the
on-chain check affordable.

### Size and cost (documented measurements)

| Metric | Measured |
|---|---|
| Circuit size | About 19 million constraints (19,075,097 in the measured runs) |
| Local dev setup | About 6 min on a 12-core, 128 GB machine; about 9.6 GB key bundle on disk |
| Prove | About 1.5 min on that machine; about 2.6 min on an ordinary 16 GB machine |
| Verify off-chain | Under 1 s |
| Verify on-chain | About 2.8×10⁹ CPU steps, under the 10×10⁹ per-transaction limit |

These figures come from the demo's CLI documentation and ZeroJ's prover-memory work, and they depend
on hardware. Proving a circuit this size in commodity memory relies on the memory-mapped proving key
and the streaming setup; see [Performance](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/performance/).

## On Cardano

The demo's `OwnershipProofValidator` is a JuLC spending validator parameterized with the
verification key. On a claim it checks all of the following:

1. **The proof verifies** over `[pkh, recipient]`, where `pkh` comes from the voucher's datum.
2. **The recipient is actually paid.** Some transaction output's payment credential equals
   `recipient`, and its value is at least `refundAmount`. Checking only that such an output exists
   would let a front-runner pay a token amount and skim the rest.
3. **It's the right voucher.** The datum's `pkh` equals the proof's `pkh`.

This is a good example of "a valid proof is not authorization". The pairing check alone would let
anyone with a copied proof spend the voucher to any address. The recipient and amount checks bind
the proof to the transaction. See [Application security](https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/application-security/).

## Security considerations

- **The whole argument assumes the root seed didn't leak.** If the attacker has the recovery phrase,
  owner and attacker are cryptographically identical, and no scheme can tell them apart.
- **Trusted setup is critical here.** Whoever knows the setup randomness can forge ownership
  proofs. A locally generated key bundle is single-party and for testing only. A refund program
  needs a multi-party phase-2 ceremony (run externally with snarkjs and imported); see the
  [ceremony guide](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/trusted-setup-ceremony/).
- **Confirm the recipient.** A production refund program should also confirm the payout address
  through its own authenticated channel.
- **Protect the seed on the proving machine.** The tools read it at a hidden prompt and keep it in
  memory only, but the machine itself must be trusted.
- **Review status.** The derivation gadgets are validated against an independent implementation
  but haven't been externally audited.

> **Danger: Experimental**
>
> This is research-grade software. Don't use it to move real value or to run a live refund program
> without an MPC ceremony and external review.

## Try it

The demo lives in
[`account-ownership`](https://github.com/bloxbean/zeroj-usecases/tree/main/account-ownership). It
doesn't use `demo.sh`. Instead it ships a desktop app and a CLI (installers and a Java zip on the
repo's [releases page](https://github.com/bloxbean/zeroj-usecases/releases)). From source:

```bash
cd account-ownership
./gradlew :ui:run
```

The CLI flow is `setup` (a local, development-only key bundle, which needs `--i-understand-insecure`),
then `prove --recipient <bech32-address>`, then `verify`, or `verify --onchain` against a local Yaci
DevKit. Allow about 10 GB of free disk and use a machine with at least 16 GB of RAM. Test with the
public BIP-39 test mnemonic or a throwaway wallet, never a real recovery phrase.
