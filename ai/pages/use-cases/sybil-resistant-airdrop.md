# One claim per person

> A Sybil-resistant airdrop where each personhood credential claims once per epoch, anonymously, with the payout bound to a chosen recipient.

Canonical URL: https://zeroj.dev/use-cases/sybil-resistant-airdrop/

Airdrops, faucets and community rewards get farmed. One person spins up a thousand wallets and
claims a thousand times. Checking identity at claim time stops that, but then every claimant hands
over personal data and every claim is linked to a person. What you want is **one claim per real
human per period**, where the distributor learns only that *some* eligible person claimed.

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

## The zero-knowledge idea

**The claimant proves "a personhood issuer signed my credential, and this nullifier is the one my
credential produces for this epoch", and binds the payout to a recipient, without revealing the
credential.**

A personhood issuer checks, out of band, that each human gets exactly one credential. That's the
part zero knowledge can't do for you. The issuer signs `Poseidon(personhoodId, 0)` with EdDSA over
Jubjub. From then on:

- **Nullifier = `Poseidon(personhoodId, epoch)`.** It's the same for every claim in an epoch, so
  repeats are caught. A new epoch gives an unrelated value, so claims can't be linked across epochs.
- **Recipient binding.** The payout address is a public input the proof commits to. Someone who
  copies a proof from the mempool can't redirect the payout without invalidating it.

This is the same building block behind Semaphore-style signals and "one-per-human" claim tokens.

## What stays private, what's public

| Input | Visibility | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `personhoodId` | Secret | The credential's unique ID; revealing it would link every claim |
| Issuer signature (`sigRU`, `sigRV`, `sigS`) and helpers (`kModL`, `kQuotient`) | Secret | Revealing the signature would also link claims |
| `pkU`, `pkV` | Public | The issuer's Jubjub key; pinned by the minting policy |
| `epoch` | Public | The claim period; pinned by the policy |
| `nullifier` | Public | One per credential per epoch; becomes the minted receipt's asset name |
| `recipient` | Public | The payout destination, committed to by the proof |
| `eligible` | Public | Must be 1 |

## How it works

1. **Enrol.** The issuer verifies the person is unique, generates `personhoodId`, signs it and
   delivers the credential privately.
2. **Claim.** The holder proves with the current `epoch` and the recipient they choose.
3. **Mint a receipt.** The faucet minting policy verifies the proof and mints one "claim NFT" whose
   asset name is the nullifier. The claim pays out ADA.
4. **Repeat in the same epoch?** Same credential and same epoch give the same nullifier, so the
   claim is refused.
5. **Next epoch.** A fresh nullifier space opens and everyone can claim again.

```text
issuer ──sig(Poseidon(personhoodId, 0))──▶ holder
holder ──proof(epoch, recipient)─────────▶ faucet policy: issuer ✓ epoch ✓ eligible ✓ pairing ✓
                                             mint 1 × <nullifier> receipt, pay recipient
```

## The circuit

This is the demo's `PersonhoodAirdropProof`, unchanged apart from imports:

```java title="PersonhoodAirdropProof.java"
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.*;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.poseidon.PoseidonParams;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.poseidon.PoseidonParamsBLS12_381T3;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.zk.ZkEdDSAJubjub;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.zk.ZkPoseidon;

@ZKCircuit(name = "personhood-airdrop", version = 1)
public class PersonhoodAirdropProof {
    private static final PoseidonParams POSEIDON = PoseidonParamsBLS12_381T3.INSTANCE;

    @Prove
    ZkBool prove(ZkContext zk,
                 @Public ZkField pkU,
                 @Public ZkField pkV,
                 @Public ZkField epoch,
                 @Public ZkField nullifier,
                 @Public ZkField recipient,
                 @Public ZkBool eligible,
                 @Secret ZkField personhoodId,
                 @Secret ZkField sigRU,
                 @Secret ZkField sigRV,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 252) ZkUInt sigS,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 252) ZkUInt kModL,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 4) ZkUInt kQuotient) {

        var claimsMsg = ZkPoseidon.hash(zk, POSEIDON, personhoodId, zk.constant(0));
        ZkEdDSAJubjub.verifyWithRegisteredKey(
                zk, pkU, pkV, claimsMsg, sigRU, sigRV, sigS, kModL, kQuotient);

        // Bind the public recipient into a real (non-degenerate) R1CS row.
        recipient.mul(personhoodId);

        var computedNullifier = ZkPoseidon.hash(zk, POSEIDON, personhoodId, epoch);
        return eligible.and(computedNullifier.isEqual(nullifier));
    }
}
```

The line `recipient.mul(personhoodId)` deserves a closer look. The circuit doesn't *compute*
anything with `recipient`, but a Groth16 proof only commits to a public input that appears in at
least one constraint. Multiplying two variables emits a real constraint row. A constant
multiplication such as `recipient * 1` gets folded away and wouldn't bind anything. ZeroJ's native
Groth16 setup refuses a relation with an unbound public input rather than silently producing a key
that ignores it.

## On Cardano

The demo's `FaucetMintingPolicy` is a JuLC minting policy parameterized by the verification key,
the issuer's key and the epoch. It reads the six public inputs from the claim output's inline datum,
checks the issuer and epoch against its parameters, requires `eligible == 1`, requires exactly one
minted token whose asset name equals the nullifier, and verifies the proof with
`Groth16BLS12381Lib.verify(...)`.

A valid proof is not authorization, and this demo shows two gaps you'd close before real use:

- **Double claims are blocked off-chain.** The service keeps an in-memory set of used nullifiers.
  Cardano lets a policy mint another unit under the same asset name, so the receipt NFT alone
  doesn't prevent a second claim. A production faucet needs on-chain uniqueness: a sorted-list
  registry like the [voting](https://zeroj.dev/use-cases/private-voting/) and [NFT](https://zeroj.dev/use-cases/nft-ownership/) demos,
  or a state-thread token carrying the used-nullifier set.
- **The payout isn't checked against `recipient`.** The proof commits to the recipient, but the
  demo policy doesn't verify that an output actually pays it. The
  [account-recovery validator](https://zeroj.dev/use-cases/account-recovery/#on-cardano) shows how to enforce this.

## Security considerations

- **Uniqueness lives at the issuer.** ZK enforces "one claim per credential". It can't tell whether
  a person holds two credentials. Sybil resistance is only as good as the issuer's enrolment
  checks.
- **Stolen credentials claim once per epoch.** If a `personhoodId` and signature leak, the thief
  can claim. Plan for revocation.
- **On-chain nullifier state and recipient enforcement,** as above.
- **Epoch source.** The demo reads the epoch from configuration and pins it into the policy, so a
  new epoch means a new policy ID. Tie it to chain time for a long-running faucet.
- **Keep issuance offline.** The demo signs with `EdDSAJubjub.signCompatibilityOffline`, which is
  meant for offline, isolated use, not a network signing service.
- **Trusted setup.** The demo uses a single-party development setup; production needs an MPC
  ceremony ([Trusted setup, explained](https://zeroj.dev/learn/trusted-setup/)).

## Try it

The demo lives in
[`personhood-airdrop`](https://github.com/bloxbean/zeroj-usecases/tree/main/personhood-airdrop).
Its [tutorial](https://github.com/bloxbean/zeroj-usecases/blob/main/personhood-airdrop/SYBIL_AIRDROP_TUTORIAL.md)
walks through the design. With Yaci DevKit running (see
[Run the demos](https://zeroj.dev/use-cases/overview/#run-the-demos)):

```bash
./demo.sh airdrop --run
```

`--run` has Alice claim for the current epoch (proof generated, receipt minted on-chain, ADA paid
out) and prints the faucet status. Claim for Alice again from the UI and the service refuses it
because the nullifier is the same. Bob's claim succeeds because his credential produces a
different nullifier.
