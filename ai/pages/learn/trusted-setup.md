# Trusted setup, explained

> What a trusted setup is, why its "toxic waste" can forge proofs, how multi-party ceremonies remove the risk, and what ZeroJ provides for dev and production.

Canonical URL: https://zeroj.dev/learn/trusted-setup/

Before anyone can prove or verify a Groth16 statement, somebody has to generate the keys: a
**proving key** for provers and a **verification key** for verifiers. That generation step is
called the **trusted setup**, and it's the part of ZK most likely to be done wrong in a real
deployment. This page explains what's being trusted, why, and how to do it properly.

## The idea in one analogy

Imagine a factory that makes tamper-evident seals. To set up the production line, the factory
casts a unique mould. Seals made from the mould are public, and anyone can inspect them. Once
the line is set up, the mould is supposed to be smashed.

If someone secretly keeps the mould, they can stamp out seals that pass every inspection while
sealing nothing at all.

A trusted setup works the same way. Generating the keys requires secret random numbers. The
best known is called **tau (τ)**, and Groth16 adds a few companions of its own. The public keys
are derived from these secrets, and afterwards the secrets must be destroyed. Anyone who keeps
them can **forge proofs**: create proofs that verify for statements that are false. That's why
these secrets are nicknamed **toxic waste**.

Two properties make this worse than it sounds:

- **Forgeries are undetectable.** A forged proof is mathematically indistinguishable from an
  honest one. No verifier, on-chain or off-chain, can tell them apart.
- **The damage is silent and permanent.** If the toxic waste leaks, every proof ever verified
  with those keys becomes suspect, and you'd never know it happened.

Knowing the toxic waste doesn't, by itself, reveal anyone's secret inputs from their proofs. The risk is to
**soundness**: fake proofs, such as an under-18 user "proving" they're over 18, or someone
unlocking funds without a valid witness.

## Powers of tau

What the setup actually publishes is a long list of elliptic-curve points built from powers of τ:

```text
[1]G1, [τ]G1, [τ²]G1, [τ³]G1, …, [τⁿ]G1
[1]G2, [τ]G2, …
```

`[x]G1` means "the curve's generator point G1, multiplied by x". Because of how elliptic curves
work, you can publish `[τ]G1` without revealing τ: going backwards is the hard problem the whole
curve's security rests on.

This list is called the **powers of tau**, or a **structured reference string (SRS)**. It's stored
in a `.ptau` file. Its length sets the maximum circuit size it can support; a setup with 2²⁰
powers supports circuits up to roughly that many constraints.

## Phase 1 and phase 2

Groth16 setup happens in two phases:

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

```text
Phase 1  (universal)          Powers of tau for BLS12-381, up to size 2ⁿ
         once per curve + size ─ reusable by every circuit that fits
               │
               ▼
Phase 2  (circuit-specific)   Powers of tau + your compiled circuit (R1CS)
         once per circuit     ─ produces this circuit's proving key + verification key
                                (a snarkjs .zkey file)
```

- **Phase 1** doesn't depend on any circuit. You can reuse a large public ceremony. ZeroJ's
  ceremony runbook, for example, uses an existing attested BLS12-381 ceremony as its primary
  phase-1 source.
- **Phase 2** is specific to one circuit and introduces **its own toxic waste**. Any change to the
  circuit, such as a new constraint, a different number or order of public inputs, or a changed
  circuit parameter, means a new phase 2 and new keys. Changing input *values* never does; a new
  user or a new proof uses the same keys.

## Multi-party ceremonies: one honest participant is enough

If one party generates τ, everyone has to trust that party. A **multi-party computation (MPC)
ceremony** removes that single point of trust:

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

```text
key_0 ──► Alice mixes in her randomness ──► key_1
key_1 ──► Bob mixes in his randomness   ──► key_2
key_2 ──► Carol mixes in her randomness ──► key_3
key_3 ──► public random beacon          ──► key_final
```

Each participant takes the previous file, mixes in fresh secret randomness, publishes the
result, and destroys their randomness. The final secret is effectively the product of every
participant's contribution. To forge proofs you would need **all** of those contributions. So the keys are
safe as long as **at least one** participant was honest and really destroyed their contribution.
This is the "1-of-N" trust model.

Each contribution is publicly checkable. Anyone can re-verify the whole chain, for example with
`snarkjs zkey verify`, without trusting the coordinator. A final **random beacon**, a public value
nobody can predict in advance such as a future block hash, closes the ceremony so the last
contributor can't bias the result.

## PlonK's universal setup

PlonK only needs phase 1. One trusted SRS serves every PlonK circuit up to its size, and each
circuit's keys are derived from it with a public, deterministic computation, with no new toxic
waste per circuit. The SRS still has to come from a trustworthy ceremony, and if its τ leaks,
every circuit using it is affected at once.

ZeroJ's PlonK support is experimental; see [Groth16, PlonK & BBS](https://zeroj.dev/learn/proof-systems/).

## What ZeroJ provides

| Need | What ZeroJ offers |
|------|-------------------|
| Fast local setup for tests and demos | `PowersOfTauBLS381.generate(...)`, `Groth16Keys.setupInMemory(...)`, `Groth16SetupBLS381.setup(...)`: single-party, in-process, **insecure by design**, and disabled unless you opt in |
| Using a real phase 1 | `PtauImporterBLS381` imports snarkjs `.ptau` files |
| Using real Groth16 keys | `ZkeyImporterBLS381` imports a ceremony `.zkey`; `Groth16PkStore` and `ZkeyPkStoreImporter` stream large keys into an `mmap`-loaded store |
| Running or joining a ceremony | The `zeroj-ceremony` CLI (`export-r1cs`, `contribute`, `finalize`) and the `ZkeyContributor` library in `zeroj-tools`, producing snarkjs-compatible contributions |
| Independent verification | Contributions made with ZeroJ verify with `snarkjs zkey verify`, so nobody has to trust ZeroJ's own tool |

### The development opt-in

The in-process setup refuses to run unless you explicitly allow it:

```text
JVM system property:   -Dzeroj.allowInsecureTrustedSetup=true
or environment:        ZEROJ_ALLOW_INSECURE_TRUSTED_SETUP=true
```

Without the opt-in, the call throws an `IllegalStateException` explaining that the generator knows
the toxic waste and can forge proofs. [Installation](https://zeroj.dev/start/installation/) shows how to set the flag
for Gradle and Maven test and run tasks.

### The production path

For anything beyond local testing, the flow is:

```text
1. Compile your circuit and export it:   zeroj-ceremony export-r1cs  → circuit.r1cs
2. Start phase 2 from a trusted .ptau:   snarkjs groth16 setup      → key_0000.zkey
3. Contributors mix in randomness:       zeroj-ceremony contribute  (or snarkjs zkey contribute)
4. Close with a pre-announced beacon, and let anyone re-check:  snarkjs zkey verify
5. Import the verified key into ZeroJ:   zeroj-ceremony finalize --sha256 <verified hash>  → proving-key store
6. Pin the verification key (and, on Cardano, the resulting script hash).
```

[Running a trusted setup ceremony](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/trusted-setup-ceremony/) walks through every
step.

> **Danger: Never protect real value with development keys**

> Keys from `PowersOfTauBLS381.generate`, `Groth16Keys.setupInMemory`, or `Groth16SetupBLS381.setup`

## What needs a new setup?

| Change | New setup? |
|--------|-----------|
| New witness values, new users, new proofs | No |
| Different public input *values* | No |
| Any change to the constraints | **Yes**, a new phase 2 (Groth16) |
| Different number or order of public inputs | **Yes** |
| A different circuit parameter (for example Merkle depth) | **Yes**. It's a different circuit. |
| Circuit grows beyond the SRS size | **Yes**, and a larger phase 1 too |

Setup is expensive, so run it once per circuit version and cache the results. Never re-run it
per proof.
