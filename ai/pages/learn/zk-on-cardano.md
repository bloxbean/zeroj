Cardano can check a Groth16 proof inside a smart contract. This page explains how that works,
how a proof fits into Cardano's eUTxO model, what verification costs, and the most important lesson
of all: **a validator that only checks the proof is not secure.**

## What Cardano gives you: BLS12-381 builtins

Verifying a pairing-based proof means doing elliptic-curve math, which would be far too
expensive to write by hand in a smart contract. Plutus V3, introduced in the Conway era, added
**native BLS12-381 builtins**, specified in CIP-0381. They cover curve point arithmetic,
compression and decompression, hashing to the curve, and the two halves of a pairing check: the
**Miller loop** and the **final verification**.

That's why ZeroJ targets BLS12-381: it's the only pairing-friendly curve Cardano can verify
on-chain. (See [Groth16, PlonK & BBS](https://zeroj.dev/learn/proof-systems/) for the comparison with BN254.)

ZeroJ's on-chain Groth16 verifier is Java code compiled to Plutus V3 by
[JuLC](https://github.com/bloxbean/julc). When it runs, it:

1. reads the public inputs,
2. decompresses the proof points (A, C in G1; B in G2),
3. combines the public inputs with the verification key: one scalar multiplication per input,
4. runs four Miller loops and one final check to confirm the Groth16 pairing equation.

## How a proof fits into eUTxO

On Cardano, funds and state live in **UTxOs** (unspent transaction outputs). A UTxO locked at a
script address can only be spent by a transaction that the script, called a **validator**,
approves. The validator sees three things: the UTxO's **datum**, the spender's **redeemer**, and
the **ScriptContext**, a description of the whole transaction.

ZK verification maps onto that model naturally:

| eUTxO piece | Role in ZK verification |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Validator script | The verifier. The **verification key is baked in** as script parameters at deploy time, so each VK produces a different script hash and address. |
| Datum | The **public inputs**, in ZeroJ's reusable verifier. Your own validator may instead derive them from the transaction or from on-chain state. |
| Redeemer | The **proof**: A, B, and C as compressed BLS12-381 points, 192 bytes in total. |
| ScriptContext | The transaction being validated. This is where **your application rules** live. |

The typical flow, step by step:

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

```text
 Lock    Alice pays ADA to the verifier script address, with the public inputs as datum.

 Spend   Bob builds a transaction that spends that UTxO.
         Redeemer = his proof.
         The validator checks the proof against the datum using Plutus V3 BLS12-381 builtins
         (and, in a real application, checks the transaction against its policy).
         Valid → the transaction succeeds. Invalid → the whole transaction fails.
```

[Verify your proof on Cardano](https://zeroj.dev/tutorials/verify-on-cardano/) runs exactly this flow on a local
Yaci DevKit network.

## What verification costs

Every Plutus script execution has a budget of CPU and memory units, with a per-transaction
maximum. Groth16 is the cheapest pairing-based option because its verification work is fixed,
apart from one extra scalar multiplication per public input.

In ZeroJ's JuLC VM tests, the reusable Groth16 verifier, run as a spending validator with a full
`ScriptContext`, measured:

| Public inputs | CPU units | Memory units |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | about 2.63 billion | about 178,000 |
| 2 | about 2.82 billion | about 212,000 |
| 3 | about 3.02 billion | about 246,000 |

That's roughly a quarter to a third of the per-transaction CPU limit of 10 billion units under
current protocol parameters, leaving room for your own validation logic. Each extra public input
adds about 0.2 billion CPU units, and transaction fees scale with the units used, so keep public
inputs to what the validator actually needs. Measure your own validator too: its policy checks
add cost, and a JuLC compiler upgrade can shift the numbers.

`zeroj-onchain-julc` includes two planning helpers: `ScriptBudgetEstimator` estimates CPU and
memory for a proof system, curve, and public-input count, and `OnChainFeasibility` reports which
combinations are practical on Plutus V3. Script size matters too, since the verification key
lives in the script. Deploying the validator once as a **reference script** (CIP-0033) avoids
attaching it to every transaction.

## Verifying off-chain instead

You don't always need the chain to check the math. If your application only needs a
**tamper-evident record**, you can verify the proof in Java (in a backend, an indexer, or a
client), then record a hash of the proof and its public inputs, or a new state root, in
transaction metadata using Cardano Client Lib.

| | On-chain verification | Off-chain verification + anchoring |
|---|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Who checks the proof | Every Cardano node, as part of consensus | Your verifier, plus anyone who re-checks later |
| Can an invalid proof move funds? | No; the transaction fails | The chain doesn't check the proof at all, so your off-chain logic must |
| Cost | Plutus execution units, roughly 2.6 to 3 billion CPU units per proof | Only metadata bytes |
| Good for | Unlocking funds, minting, state transitions enforced by the ledger | Audit trails, attestations, batch results, off-chain protocols |

ZeroJ's current release doesn't ship an anchoring helper. You write the metadata yourself with
Cardano Client Lib, choosing what to commit to.

## Proof validity is not authorization

This is the part that separates a demo from a real application.

A reusable verifier such as `Groth16BLS12381Verifier` (the on-chain validator in
`zeroj-onchain-julc`) checks exactly one thing:

> *Some* witness satisfies *this* circuit for *these* public inputs.

It does **not** check who is spending, where the money goes, whether this proof was used before,
or whether the public inputs match your application's current state. On its own, it's safe for
tests and demos, and nothing else. Here's what goes wrong if you deploy it as-is:

- **Replay.** Proofs are public once they're on-chain. If two UTxOs sit at the same script with
  the same datum, one proof unlocks both. Anyone can copy it.
- **Front-running.** Your unlock transaction is visible before it's confirmed. Someone can copy
  your proof into their own transaction that pays *them*, because nothing in the proof names the
  recipient.
- **Double use.** A voter proves "I'm on the voter list" and votes twice. Both proofs are valid.
- **Stale or wrong context.** A proof of membership in an old Merkle root still verifies, unless
  the validator checks the root against current state.

The defenses all have the same shape: **bind the proof's public inputs to the transaction and
the application state, then have the validator enforce that binding.**

**Bind to the UTxO being spent.** Make the first public input a value derived from the output
being spent:

```text
first public input  =  blake2b_256( spentTxId ‖ spentOutputIndex as 32 bytes )  mod r
```

(`r` is the BLS12-381 scalar field order.) The prover computes this value for the UTxO it is about
to spend and proves with it, and the validator recomputes it from `ScriptContext`. A proof made
for one UTxO is then useless for any other. The validator must compute the value itself rather
than read it from the locked UTxO's datum, because a datum can't contain a hash of its own
transaction. ZeroJ's `Groth16BLS12381TxOutRefBindingVerifier` demonstrates the check but reads it
from the datum, so treat it as a reference, not a lock. [Verify your proof on
Cardano](https://zeroj.dev/tutorials/verify-on-cardano/) builds a validator that does this correctly.

**Bind to the recipient and outputs.** Make the recipient's key hash, or a commitment to the
intended outputs, a public input, and have the validator check the transaction pays exactly that.
A copied proof then only ever pays the original recipient.

**Use nullifiers for one-time actions.** A nullifier is a public value derived from the prover's
secret, for example `Poseidon(secret, electionId)`. It's always the same for the same secret and
scope, but reveals nothing about the secret. The validator records used nullifiers in on-chain
state and rejects repeats, which stops double voting and double claiming. ZeroJ doesn't provide a
generic nullifier registry; your application designs and stores it. The
[private allowlist tutorial](https://zeroj.dev/tutorials/private-allowlist/) shows a nullifier in practice.

**Check public inputs against state.** If the proof says "I'm in the tree with root R", the
validator must confirm that R is the current root, for example from a datum or reference input.

**Enforce everything else through ScriptContext.** Required signatures, validity intervals,
continuing outputs, value conservation, and minting rules are ordinary validator logic. ZK doesn't
replace any of it.

In practice you write your own validator: compose ZeroJ's on-chain library
(`Groth16BLS12381Lib`) for the proof check and add your policy around it.
[On-chain verification](https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/on-chain/) shows how.
