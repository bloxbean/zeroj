# Circuits, constraints & witnesses

> How ZK circuits really work (equations over a finite field, R1CS, witnesses), why Java control flow doesn't apply, and how under-constrained circuits break.

In [Zero-knowledge in plain English](https://zeroj.dev/learn/zero-knowledge-basics/) we treated a circuit as a
function that returns `true` or `false`. That's a useful first picture, but it isn't how circuits
work, and the gap between the two is where most ZK security bugs come from. This page closes that
gap.

## A circuit is a system of equations

A ZK circuit doesn't *run*. It's a list of equations, called **constraints**, over a set of
variables, called **wires**. A proof shows that the prover knows values for all the wires that make
every equation true at once.

Here's the statement "I know `x` such that `x³ + x + 5 = 35`", written as constraints:

```text
v1  = x  · x          constraint 1
v2  = v1 · x          constraint 2
out = v2 + x + 5      constraint 3
```

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

With `x = 3`, the wires are `v1 = 9`, `v2 = 27`, `out = 35`, and all three equations hold. The
verifier never sees `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. It only learns that some assignment satisfies every
constraint with `out = 35`.

Notice the shape: each constraint does at most **one multiplication**. That's not a style choice.
It's the format the proof system understands.

## R1CS: one multiplication per constraint

Groth16 consumes circuits in **R1CS** form (rank-1 constraint system). Every constraint looks like:

```text
(linear combination A) × (linear combination B) = (linear combination C)
```

A *linear combination* is a sum of wires times constants, like `v2 + x + 5`. Additions are free;
they fold into the linear combinations. Multiplications of two wires each cost one constraint.
The simplest possible circuit, "I know `b` such that `a · b = product`", is a single constraint:

```text
(a) × (b) = (product)
```

When people say a circuit has "54 constraints" or "19 million constraints", they're counting
these rows. More constraints mean a bigger proving key and a slower prover. Verification cost
doesn't change: Groth16 verification depends on the number of public inputs, not the number of
constraints.

## Field arithmetic: numbers that wrap around

Circuit wires don't hold Java `int`s or `long`s. They hold **field elements**, which are whole
numbers modulo a large prime. For BLS12-381, the curve ZeroJ uses for Cardano, that prime is a
255-bit number called `r`:

```text
r = 52435875175126190479447740508185965837690552500527637822603658699938581184513
```

Think of it as a clock with `r` hours. Arithmetic works like normal until you pass `r`, then it
wraps around. That has consequences Java developers don't expect:

| Expression | In Java | In the field |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| `3 - 5` | `-2` | `r - 2`, a huge positive number. There are no negative numbers. |
| `1 / 2` | `0` | `(r + 1) / 2`, the number that gives 1 when doubled. There are no fractions or decimals, only inverses. |
| `x > 5` | a comparison | Not defined. Field elements have no built-in order. |
| `(r - 1) + 1` | `r` (using `BigInteger`) | `0` |

The last two rows are the dangerous ones. To prove "`age ≥ 18`", a circuit can't just compare. It
has to prove the numbers are small, by splitting them into bits, and only then compare the bits.
Proving that a value fits in `n` bits is called a **range check**, and forgetting one is the
most common way to break a circuit.

## The witness: every wire, filled in

The **witness** is the complete list of values for every wire in the circuit: the public inputs,
the secret inputs, and every intermediate value. For the `x³ + x + 5` example it's
`[1, 35, 3, 9, 27]`.

In ZeroJ, `calculateWitness(...)` produces it as a `BigInteger[]` with a fixed layout:

```text
index 0        the constant 1 (every R1CS uses a "one" wire for constants)
index 1..n     the n public inputs, in the circuit's declared order
index n+1..    secret inputs and intermediate wires
```

The explainer near the top of this page shows that layout for `x³ + x + 5`: the constant, then the
public `out`, then the secret wires.

The witness contains your secrets, so it **never leaves the prover**. The prover turns it into a
proof, and only the proof and the public inputs travel.

## Constraints describe; they don't execute

Because a circuit is a set of equations and not a program, ordinary Java control flow doesn't
translate.

**No `if` on secrets.** An `if` in your Java code runs once, while the circuit is being *built*,
before any secret exists. It can't depend on a secret value. Instead, you compute both branches and
use a constraint to pick one:

```java
// In Java you'd write:  fee == (isMember ? 0 : 5)
ZkField expected = isMember.select(zk.constant(0), zk.constant(5));
return expected.isEqual(fee);
```

Under the hood, `select` is the equation `result = isMember · (0 − 5) + 5`. It only works as a
choice if `isMember` is exactly 0 or 1.

**No `&&`, `||`, `!` on secrets.** Same reason. Use `ZkBool.and(...)`, `or(...)`, and `not()`,
which emit the equivalent equations.

**Booleans need their own constraint.** In a field, a "boolean" is just a number. A value is only
0 or 1 if a constraint says so: `b · (b − 1) = 0`. In the `select` above, a cheater who sets
`isMember = 2` would get `expected = 2 · (−5) + 5`, which is not a fee anyone intended. ZeroJ's
`ZkBool` adds the boolean constraint for you, so `isMember = 2` is rejected.

## The under-constrained circuit bug

Here's the most important idea on this page:

> A circuit only enforces the equations you actually wrote down, not the ones you meant.

If an intended rule has no constraint behind it, a cheater can pick any value that satisfies the
remaining equations, and the proof will verify. This is called an **under-constrained circuit**,
and it's the most common serious bug class in ZK applications.

Here's a concrete, runnable example. The idea: "prove `age ≥ threshold` by showing
`age = threshold + diff`, where `diff` is a non-negative secret".

```java title="BuggyAgeCheck.java"
// BUG: nothing says `diff` is small and non-negative.
@ZKCircuit(name = "buggy-age-check", version = 1)
public class BuggyAgeCheck {
    @Prove
    ZkBool prove(@Secret ZkField age,
                 @Secret ZkField diff,
                 @Public ZkField threshold) {
        return age.isEqual(threshold.add(diff));
    }
}
```

An honest 25-year-old uses `diff = 7`, and everything looks fine. Tests with honest inputs pass.
Now a 16-year-old cheats:

```text
age       = 16
threshold = 18
diff      = r − 2          ("−2" in the field)

threshold + diff = 18 + (r − 2) = r + 16 ≡ 16 = age   ✓  the equation holds
```

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

ZeroJ's own witness calculator accepts these inputs, and the resulting proof verifies. The
circuit said "equal", and the values *are* equal in the field. It never said "`diff` is a small,
non-negative number".

The fix is to state the missing rule. In ZeroJ, `ZkUInt` with `@UInt(bits = N)` adds range
constraints that force each value into `0 … 2ᴺ − 1`:

```java title="FixedAgeCheck.java"
@ZKCircuit(name = "fixed-age-check", version = 1)
public class FixedAgeCheck {
    @Prove
    ZkBool prove(@Secret @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt age,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt diff,
                 @Public @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt threshold) {
        return age.isEqual(threshold.add(diff));
    }
}
```

Now `diff = r − 2` doesn't fit in 8 bits, so no valid witness exists. The fixed circuit has 56
constraints instead of 5, and those extra constraints are exactly the rules that were missing.
In a real circuit you'd simply write `age.gte(threshold)`, which does the same range-checked
comparison for you.

## How ZeroJ helps

ZeroJ can't design your circuit for you, but it removes the most common traps:

- **Symbolic types.** You write circuits with `ZkField`, `ZkBool`, `ZkUInt`, and friends instead
  of Java primitives. You can't accidentally branch on a secret, because a `ZkBool` isn't a
  `boolean`.
- **Range checks by declaration.** `@UInt(bits = N)` on a `ZkUInt` input adds its range
  constraints when the value is created. Comparisons like `gte` and `lt` require range-checked
  operands.
- **Constrained booleans.** Every `ZkBool` is constrained to 0 or 1.
- **A gadget library.** Poseidon hashing, Merkle membership, comparators, bit decomposition, and
  more are written once and reused. For Cardano circuits, use Poseidon with explicit BLS12-381
  parameters (`PoseidonParamsBLS12_381T3.INSTANCE`). See [Gadgets](https://zeroj.dev/guides/circuits/gadgets/).
- **Witness checking.** `calculateWitness(...)` checks every constraint and throws an
  `ArithmeticException` when one fails, which makes invalid-witness tests easy to write.

A small annotated circuit, and a test that it rejects a false claim, looks like this:

```java title="AgeCheck.java"
@ZKCircuit(name = "age-check", version = 1)
public class AgeCheck {
    @Prove
    ZkBool prove(@Secret @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt age,
                 @Public @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt threshold) {
        return age.gte(threshold);
    }
}
```

```java title="AgeCheckTest.java"
var circuit = AgeCheckCircuit.build();   // generated by the annotation processor

// Honest witness: 25 ≥ 18
var ok = AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().age(25).threshold(18);
circuit.calculateWitness(ok.toWitnessMap(), CurveId.BLS12_381);

// Invalid witnesses must be rejected
var tooYoung = AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().age(16).threshold(18);
assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class,
        () -> circuit.calculateWitness(tooYoung.toWitnessMap(), CurveId.BLS12_381));

var outOfRange = AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().age(300).threshold(18);   // doesn't fit in 8 bits
assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class,
        () -> circuit.calculateWitness(outOfRange.toWitnessMap(), CurveId.BLS12_381));
```
