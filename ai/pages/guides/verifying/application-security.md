# Secure your ZK application

> A practical threat-model checklist for ZeroJ builders — authorization, replay, nullifiers, trusted inputs, setup, circuit soundness and secrets.

Canonical URL: https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/application-security/

A zero-knowledge proof answers one narrow question: *does the prover know private values that
satisfy this circuit, for these public inputs, under this verification key?* Every other property
your application needs (who may act, how often, with what money, based on whose data) is something
**you** must design, bind and check.

This page walks through the mistakes that turn a correct proof into a broken application, and ends
with a checklist you can copy into a design review. It applies to off-chain services and Cardano
validators alike.

## Start with a threat model

Before writing a circuit, sort every value into one of three buckets:

| Bucket | Examples | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Untrusted** | The proof, public inputs, envelope fields (`circuitId`, `vkRef`, metadata), BBS presentations, datums anyone can create, redeemers | Validate, and bind to context, before acting on them. |
| **Secret** | The witness, issuer signing keys, BBS key material, wallet seeds, trusted-setup toxic waste | Minimize lifetime, never log or persist, keep off shared machines. |
| **Trusted** | Verification keys *you* pinned, issuer public keys *you* distribute, your own state (nullifier sets, roots) | Load from storage you control. Never accept these from the prover. |

## Proof validity is not authorization

ZeroJ's verifiers return `proofValid() == true` when the math checks out. They do not know who
sent the proof, whether it was used before, or whether the action it justifies is allowed. On
Cardano, the reusable `Groth16BLS12381Verifier` validator doesn't even look at the transaction.

Keep the two decisions visibly separate in code. Off-chain, a verifier backend returns
`VerificationResult.cryptoValid()`, with `accepted() == false`. Only your policy layer should
produce `VerificationResult.ok()`. See [Verify proofs in Java](https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/off-chain/#build-a-verification-service).
The explainer under [Replay and front-running](#replay-and-front-running) shows what goes wrong when
only the proof is checked.

## Replay and front-running

A proof is a public, copyable object. Anyone who sees it (in a log, an API response, or the Cardano
mempool) can submit it again unless the statement ties it to one specific use.

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

- **Bind to the spend.** On Cardano, make a public input depend on the UTxO being spent, for
  example `spendRef = blake2b_256(spentTxId || outputIndex) mod r` as public input 0. Your validator
  must compute that value from `ScriptContext`, not read it from the datum of the UTxO it guards:
  a datum can't contain a hash of its own transaction. The bundled
  `Groth16BLS12381TxOutRefBindingVerifier` reads it from the datum, so it demonstrates the check
  but can't lock real funds as-is. See [Verify proofs on Cardano](https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/on-chain/#bind-the-proof-to-the-spend).
- **Bind to the beneficiary.** A proof that is bound only to a UTxO can still be front-run: a
  watcher copies the redeemer into a transaction that pays *them*. Put the recipient in the statement
  and check the outputs on-chain.
- **Bind to a session off-chain.** For API verification, include a server-issued, random,
  single-use nonce in the statement and consume it on first use.
- **BBS presentation headers.** A BBS presentation signs over its presentation header (`ph`).
  Off-chain, the verifier picks `ph` as a fresh random challenge and accepts it once. On-chain,
  derive the expected `ph` from `ScriptContext`, e.g. `blake2b_256(txId || index || recipientPkh)`.
  `BbsService.verifyPresentation` reads `ph` from the presentation itself, so **you** must compare
  it with the value you expect. See [Selective disclosure with BBS](https://zeroj.dev/guides/credentials/bbs/).

## Nullifiers

When the rule is "each member may act once", such as one vote per election or one claim per
airdrop, use a **nullifier**: a public value that is the same every time the same member acts in
the same scope, but reveals nothing about who they are.

```text
nullifier = Poseidon(memberSecret, scopeId)      // scopeId: election, airdrop, epoch…
```

The circuit must prove all of these at once:

1. `memberSecret` belongs to an eligible member, e.g. `Poseidon(memberSecret)` is a leaf under the
   published membership Merkle root;
2. `nullifier` was computed from **that same** secret and the public `scopeId`;
3. whatever else the action requires.

If step 1 and step 2 use different secrets, a member can mint unlimited fresh nullifiers. Different
scopes give unlinkable nullifiers, so a member's votes in two elections can't be connected. For
Cardano circuits, compute Poseidon with the explicit BLS12-381 parameters,
`PoseidonParamsBLS12_381T3.INSTANCE`.

Then **store and check** spent nullifiers:

| Where | How | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Off-chain database | Unique index on the nullifier; insert atomically in the same transaction as the action | Simple and fast; you are trusted to enforce it |
| On-chain state UTxO | One registry UTxO whose datum lists nullifiers | Trustless, but sequential and limited by datum size |
| On-chain token per nullifier | Mint a token named by the nullifier | Parallel, but must still prevent duplicate names |
| On-chain sorted linked list | One UTxO per nullifier; insertion proves the gap | Trustless and concurrent; locks some ADA per entry |
| On-chain Merkle root | Keep only a root; prove insertion in a second circuit | Constant size; needs an off-chain tree service |

ZeroJ's [private voting design](https://zeroj.dev/use-cases/private-voting/) compares these in detail. The
[private allowlist tutorial](https://zeroj.dev/tutorials/private-allowlist/) builds a membership proof with a
nullifier.

## Bind public inputs to their meaning

A public input is just a number. The verifier checks the proof *for that number*. It doesn't
know the number is meant to be "the current epoch" or "this pool's address".

- **Check every public input against the real context** at verification time: amounts against
  the transaction value, addresses against outputs, epochs and deadlines against the validity
  range, roots against your stored state.
- **Keep the order fixed.** Public inputs are positional. Document the order next to the
  circuit, and test that swapping two inputs makes verification fail.
- **Separate domains.** Include a scope, network or contract-instance identifier in hashes and
  nullifiers, so a proof for one deployment is useless in another.

## Trust your data sources

A circuit proves a computation over its inputs. It cannot tell whether a secret input is *true*. If
a prover can type their own balance, age or KYC status into the witness, the proof only shows they
can type.

Anchor every fact to something the verifier already trusts:

- an **issuer signature** over the attributes (a BBS credential, or a signature checked
  in-circuit);
- a **commitment** published by a trusted party or on-chain, such as a Merkle root of balances or
  of allowlisted members, that the circuit opens;
- a **key the user provably controls**, as in the account-recovery use case, which derives a
  Cardano key inside the circuit.

Then ask who can change that anchor, and how the verifier learns about updates and revocations.

## Trusted setup, key pinning and versions

- **Groth16 keys come from a ceremony.** ZeroJ's in-process setup (`Groth16Keys.setupInMemory`,
  `PowersOfTauBLS381.generate`, `Groth16SetupBLS381.setup`) knows the toxic waste and can forge
  proofs. It refuses to run unless you opt in, and it is for development only. Production keys
  come from a multi-party ceremony (snarkjs `.zkey`, imported). See
  [Trusted setup, explained](https://zeroj.dev/learn/trusted-setup/) and the
  [ceremony guide](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/trusted-setup-ceremony/).
- **Pin the VK.** Off-chain, compare the VK's SHA-256 against a value in your configuration.
  On-chain, the VK is a script parameter, so the script hash pins it.
- **Version circuits.** Any change to a circuit, even a "harmless" refactor, can change its
  constraints and therefore its keys. Give each version its own ID, VK hash and (on-chain)
  script, and retire old versions explicitly.
- **Record provenance.** Keep the circuit source revision, compiler version, R1CS hash, ceremony
  transcript and VK hash together, so anyone can check the chain from code to key.

## Under-constrained circuits

The most common ZK bug is a circuit that *computes* the right answer for honest inputs but doesn't
*constrain* it. A dishonest prover then finds other witness values that also satisfy the
constraints. Passing tests with honest witnesses tells you nothing about this.

- **Write invalid-witness tests.** For every rule, craft a witness that breaks it and check that
  witness generation fails, or that a proof built from it doesn't verify.
  See [Testing circuits](https://zeroj.dev/guides/circuits/testing-circuits/).
- **Range-check numbers.** Inputs are field elements. ZeroJ's witness calculator reduces each
  input modulo the field order, so `-1` becomes a 255-bit number. Comparisons like "age ≥ 18" are
  only meaningful with explicit bit-width constraints.
- **Constrain booleans and outputs.** A "flag" must be constrained to 0 or 1, and every output you
  rely on must be tied to the inputs by constraints, not just assigned.
- **Don't trust hints.** Values computed outside the constraint system (inverses, quotients) must
  be checked by constraints afterwards.
- **Prefer the library gadgets** and read their status in the [gadget guide](https://zeroj.dev/guides/circuits/gadgets/).

## Secrets in Java

- **`BigInteger` is not constant-time**, and ZeroJ does not claim that witness generation or the
  pure-Java prover are constant-time. Run proving on hardware you control, not next to untrusted
  tenants.
- **BBS issuer keys.** The default pure-Java BBS provider routes secret scalar multiplications
  through fixed-schedule code, but it is *not* a full JVM constant-time guarantee. For issuer keys
  and high-value signing, select the blst provider with
  `BbsService.withBlsProvider(BbsCiphersuite.BLS12381_SHA256, BlstBls12381Provider.createDefault())`.
- **Short witness lifetime.** The witness (`BigInteger[]`) contains every secret. Don't log it,
  cache it or serialize it. snarkjs `.wtns` files hold the same secrets, so keep them off disk or
  on tmpfs and delete them. JVM objects can't be reliably wiped, so keep secrets in a short-lived
  process where you can.
- **Randomness.** Use `SecureRandom` for key material, nonces and challenges. BBS key generation
  needs at least 32 bytes of key material.

## Metadata leaks

A perfect proof can still leak through everything around it:

- **Public inputs and revealed attributes** are public. Combinations of "harmless" disclosed
  fields (birth year + postcode + employer) can identify a person.
- **On-chain linkability.** Funding a claim from a known wallet, reusing addresses, or paying
  fees from the same UTxO set links actions together, whatever the proof hides.
- **Amounts and timing.** Exact amounts and the timing between issuance, proving and submission
  can correlate users. Batch, round, or delay where it matters.
- **Scope reuse.** Reusing one nullifier scope across unrelated actions makes them linkable.

## Development flags never reach production

Two JVM switches exist for development only:

| Flag | What it unlocks |
|---|---|
| `-Dzeroj.allowInsecureTrustedSetup=true` / `ZEROJ_ALLOW_INSECURE_TRUSTED_SETUP=true` | Single-party trusted setup whose creator can forge proofs |
| `-Dzeroj.allowLegacyBn254=true` / `ZEROJ_ALLOW_LEGACY_BN254=true` | Legacy BN254 proving/verification (not a Cardano curve) |

Make production refuse to start with either one set:

```java
import org.zeroj.api.LegacyCurvePolicy;
import org.zeroj.api.TrustedSetupPolicy;

if (TrustedSetupPolicy.insecureTrustedSetupEnabled() || LegacyCurvePolicy.legacyBn254Enabled()) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("ZeroJ development flags are enabled; refusing to start");
}
```

See [Configuration](https://zeroj.dev/reference/configuration/) for every switch.

## The checklist

Copy this into your design review. Every "no" or "not sure" is work to do before real users arrive.

```text title="zk-app-review-checklist.md"
## Statement
- [ ] Every intended rule is a constraint; outputs, booleans and ranges are constrained
- [ ] Invalid-witness tests exist for every rule (not just honest-witness tests)
- [ ] Public vs secret inputs are correct; public-input order is documented and tested
- [ ] Secret facts are anchored to an issuer signature, commitment or key the verifier trusts

## Binding & replay
- [ ] The statement is bound to its context (UTxO / tx / session nonce / scope / network)
- [ ] The beneficiary is bound, so a copied proof can't redirect value (front-running)
- [ ] Nullifier = H(secret, scope) uses the SAME secret as the membership proof
- [ ] Spent nullifiers are stored and checked atomically (on-chain state or unique DB index)
- [ ] BBS: ph is verifier-chosen (or derived from ScriptContext) and compared before accepting

## Keys & setup
- [ ] Groth16 keys come from a multi-party ceremony; provenance recorded
- [ ] VK hashes pinned in config; circuit IDs + versions allowlisted; old versions retired
- [ ] The verifier never accepts a VK, circuit ID or VK reference from the prover
- [ ] zeroj.allowInsecureTrustedSetup / zeroj.allowLegacyBn254 are rejected at startup

## Cardano
- [ ] Validator binds ScriptContext: spent input, outputs, signers, validity range, minting
- [ ] Budget measured in the JuLC VM and on a devnet against current protocol limits
- [ ] Script hash recorded; JuLC upgrades treated as a new script

## Secrets & privacy
- [ ] Witness data is short-lived, never logged/persisted; .wtns files kept off disk
- [ ] Issuer keys use the blst BBS provider; SecureRandom for keys, nonces, challenges
- [ ] Disclosed attributes, public inputs, amounts, timing and addresses reviewed for linkability

## Evidence
- [ ] Independent test vectors / differential checks where they exist
- [ ] External review planned before any value-bearing use
```
