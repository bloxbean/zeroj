# Prove with Groth16

> Set up keys, generate Groth16 proofs on BLS12-381, scale to millions of constraints, and export proofs and keys for verifiers.

Canonical URL: https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/groth16/

Groth16 on BLS12-381 is ZeroJ's primary proof system and **the focus of the current release**.
It's the path used in every tutorial, the one verified end to end on-chain against Yaci DevKit,
and the one Cardano verifies with Plutus V3's built-in BLS12-381 operations. Proofs are small
(three curve points) and cheap to verify. The trade-off is a trusted setup per circuit.

Like the rest of ZeroJ, this path is research software. Its status is **Beta**: feature-complete
and correctness-tested, but not externally audited and not for value-bearing or mainnet use. See
[Status & maturity](https://zeroj.dev/start/status/).

This guide covers the `zeroj-crypto` API: where keys live, how to prove, how to scale up, what
the fail-closed checks mean, and how to hand proofs to verifiers.

## Choose where the proving key lives

`Groth16Keys` is the front door: one handle for the key material wherever it lives, and one
`prove` that works the same against all of them. You make one decision, at setup time:

| Key home | Get it with | When | Memory |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| Heap | `Groth16Keys.setupInMemory(...)` | Tests and small circuits | Whole key on the heap |
| Key store, sparse | `Groth16Keys.setupToStore(..., true)` | Large local circuits (recommended store format) | Streamed setup; the key is memory-mapped, so it uses page cache, not heap |
| Key store, dense | `Groth16Keys.setupToStore(..., false)` | Interchange with older tools | Same profile, larger files |
| Imported ceremony key | `ZkeyPkStoreImporter.importToPkStore(zkey, dir, sha256)`, then `Groth16Keys.load(dir, manifestSha256)` | Anything beyond local testing | Memory-mapped at prove time |

`Groth16Keys` is `AutoCloseable`. Use try-with-resources so store-backed keys are unmapped.

> **Caution: The first three rows are development keys**
>
> `setupInMemory` and `setupToStore` run a **single-party** setup: your process knows the secret
> randomness and could forge proofs. ZeroJ refuses to run them unless you opt in with
> `-Dzeroj.allowInsecureTrustedSetup=true` (or `ZEROJ_ALLOW_INSECURE_TRUSTED_SETUP=true`); without
> it they throw `IllegalStateException`. Keys that protect anything real come from a multi-party
> ceremony. See [Run a trusted setup ceremony](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/trusted-setup-ceremony/).

## Flow 1: small circuits, keys in memory

The examples use the `SealedBid` circuit and its filled-in `inputs` from
[Write circuits with annotations](https://zeroj.dev/guides/circuits/annotations/#the-generated-companion). Any
`CircuitBuilder` works the same way.

```java
var circuit = SealedBidCircuit.build();
var r1cs = circuit.compileR1CS(CurveId.BLS12_381);
BigInteger[] witness = inputs.calculateWitness(circuit, CurveId.BLS12_381);   // witness[0] == 1

// DEV/TEST ONLY: single-party setup. Groth16 setup uses only the tau scalar.
BigInteger tau = PowersOfTauBLS381.generate(4).tauScalar();

try (var keys = Groth16Keys.setupInMemory(
        r1cs.constraints(), r1cs.numWires(), r1cs.numPublicInputs(), tau)) {
    Groth16ProofBLS381 proof = keys.prove(witness, r1cs.constraints());
}
```

Nothing touches disk. This is fine up to a few hundred thousand constraints.

## Flow 2: bigger circuits, keys on disk

`setupToStore` streams every proving-key point straight into memory-mapped files, so the key is
never fully on the heap. Pass the packed constraints (`r1cs.flat()`) and a directory:

```java
Path keysDir = Path.of("keys/sealed-bid-v1");

// DEV/TEST ONLY
try (var keys = Groth16Keys.setupToStore(
        r1cs.flat(), r1cs.numWires(), r1cs.numPublicInputs(), tau, keysDir, true)) {
    Groth16ProofBLS381 proof = keys.prove(witness, r1cs.constraints());
}

// Every later run reopens the bundle. Sparse or dense is detected from the manifest.
try (var keys = Groth16Keys.load(keysDir)) {
    Groth16ProofBLS381 proof = keys.prove(witness, r1cs.constraints());
}
```

`sparse = true` stores points at infinity as a single bit each, which makes the on-disk key much
smaller for large circuits.

## Flow 3: keys from a ceremony

For real deployments, the proving key comes from a snarkjs multi-party ceremony `.zkey`. Import it
once into the same store layout, pinned to the SHA-256 of the final key that passed
`snarkjs zkey verify` (the ceremony transcript publishes it):

```java
// Streaming, multi-GB safe. The target directory must not exist yet.
var imported = ZkeyPkStoreImporter.importToPkStore(
        Path.of("circuit_final.zkey"), keysDir, verifiedZkeySha256);
String manifestSha256 = imported.manifestSha256();   // keep it with your deployment config
```

The import checks the file against that hash, validates every point (curve, subgroup and
canonical encoding), and seals the store. It does not check that the key matches your circuit or
re-verify the ceremony; that's what `snarkjs zkey verify` is for. There is no two-argument
`importToPkStore(zkey, dir)`: code that skips the hash doesn't compile.
`importUnpinnedToPkStore` exists for local tests only. Later loads are pinned to the store's
manifest hash.

snarkjs appends one public-input binding row per public signal (plus one for the constant wire)
after your circuit's rows, so you must tell the prover about them:

```java
int numPublic = r1cs.numPublicInputs();

try (var keys = Groth16Keys.load(keysDir, manifestSha256)) {
    // List form: append snarkjs's binding rows to your compiled constraints
    var proof = keys.prove(witness,
            ZkeyPkStoreImporter.snarkjsConstraints(r1cs.constraints(), numPublic));

    // Packed form: pass the number of binding rows instead (0 for locally generated keys)
    var proof2 = keys.prove(ProverBackend.PURE_JAVA,
            FlatScalars.pack(witness, witness.length), r1cs.flat(), numPublic + 1);
}
```

The ceremony must have been run on **exactly** the R1CS you compile, exported with
`zeroj-ceremony export-r1cs` or `R1CSSerializer.serialize(r1cs)`. For small keys (up to 128 MB)
there is also an in-memory importer that can pin the file's SHA-256 before parsing:
`ZkeyImporterBLS381.importZkeyFull(bytes, expectedSha256)`. It returns the proving key and the
constraints for `Groth16ProverBLS381.prove(...)`. Circom circuits follow the same import path;
see [Bring circom & snarkjs circuits](https://zeroj.dev/tutorials/snarkjs-interop/).

## The packed prove path

The list form boxes every coefficient and witness value as a `BigInteger`. At millions of
constraints, use the packed overload with `R1CSFlat` constraints and `FlatScalars` witness values:

```java
FlatScalars w = FlatScalars.pack(witness, witness.length);
Groth16ProofBLS381 proof = keys.prove(ProverBackend.PURE_JAVA, w, r1cs.flat(), /* bindingRows */ 0);
```

`FlatScalars.packConsuming(witness, n)` does the same but nulls out the `BigInteger[]` as it goes,
so the boxed values can be garbage-collected early. `ProverBackend.PURE_JAVA` is the default,
multi-core pure-Java backend; the opt-in native backend is covered in
[Performance & large circuits](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/performance/).

## Groth16Pipeline for very large circuits

`Groth16Pipeline` packages the orchestration ZeroJ uses for its ~19-million-constraint
account-ownership circuit: a constraint cache written during setup, witness generation *before*
the constraints are memory-mapped (so the two memory peaks never overlap), and a circuit
fingerprint that fails fast if a key bundle doesn't match the circuit. You supply two things:
how to compile, and how to compute the witness.

```java
Supplier<Groth16Pipeline.Compiled> compile = () -> {
    var cs = SealedBidCircuit.build().compileR1CS(CurveId.BLS12_381);
    return new Groth16Pipeline.Compiled(
            cs.flat(), cs.numConstraints(), cs.numWires(), cs.numPublicInputs());
};
Supplier<FlatScalars> computeWitness = () -> {
    var c = SealedBidCircuit.build();                           // released when the lambda returns
    BigInteger[] w = inputs.calculateWitness(c, CurveId.BLS12_381);
    return FlatScalars.packConsuming(w, w.length);
};

// Setup (DEV/TEST ONLY): sparse store + r1cs.bin cache, bound to the circuit fingerprint
var compiled = compile.get();
String fingerprint = compiled.fingerprint();                    // record this with the bundle
var setup = Groth16Pipeline.setup(compiled, tau, keysDir, true);
String vkJson = SnarkjsGroth16Json.verificationKeyJson(setup);  // export the VK from the result
compiled = null;                                                // let the compiled circuit go

// Prove: compiles only if the cache is missing or stale
try (var keys = Groth16Keys.load(keysDir)) {
    Groth16ProofBLS381 proof = Groth16Pipeline.prove(keys,
            keysDir.resolve(Groth16Pipeline.R1CS_CACHE),
            fingerprint,
            compile, computeWitness,
            /* bindingRows */ 0, ProverBackend.PURE_JAVA);
}
```

The fingerprint has the form `c<constraints>-w<wires>-p<public>-r<sha256>`: the dimensions plus
a hash of the exact relation. A mismatch throws `IllegalStateException` before any proving work.
For an imported ceremony key, pass the fingerprint at import time, with the four-argument
`importToPkStore(zkey, dir, sha256, fingerprint)` or `zeroj-ceremony finalize --circuit-fingerprint`,
and pass `numPublic + 1` binding rows. Imported stores are sealed, so
`Groth16PkStore.bindCircuitFingerprint` works only on local, unsealed stores. `Groth16Pipeline.estimateProvePhaseHeapBytes(numWires, domain)` gives a lower bound on
prove-phase heap for preflight checks; witness generation can need more, so measure your own
circuit. An optional `Groth16Pipeline.Progress` listener reports stages for CLIs.

## Relation validation

Every setup and prove entry point checks the relation's shape before doing any work, and fails
closed with an exception instead of proceeding:

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `numWires` / `numPublic` out of range | Need `numWires >= 1` and `0 <= numPublic < numWires` |
| A wire index outside `[0, numWires)` | A constraint references a wire that doesn't exist |
| Malformed CSR offsets or coefficients | The packed `R1CSFlat` is corrupt |
| `witness length (…) must match numWires (…)` | The witness wasn't computed for this circuit |
| `witness[0] must be 1` | The constant wire is missing or wrong |
| A public wire with no nonzero coefficient | See the binding rule below |

**Every public wire must be bound.** Native setup requires each wire `0..numPublic`, including the
constant wire 0, to appear with a nonzero coefficient in at least one constraint row. A public
input that appears in no row would produce a verification-key entry at the point at infinity,
which every ZeroJ verifier (pure Java, blst, on-chain) rejects, and it would leave that public
input unbound by the proof. Circuits built with the DSL bind the constant wire through their
assertions. If you have a public input your circuit doesn't use, either drop it or make it take
part in a real multiplication with another wire, for example `recipient.mul(secret)`. A constant
multiplication such as `p * 1` is folded into a linear combination by the compiler and binds
nothing. snarkjs binds unused public signals itself, so a circuit can set up under snarkjs and
still be refused by native setup; imported ceremony keys are unaffected.

In the negligible case that the sampled randomness cancels a bound wire, setup aborts with an
`IllegalStateException` before writing anything; run it again. These exceptions mean the
relation, the dimensions, or the witness doesn't describe the circuit the key was made for. Fix
the caller; don't catch and retry.

## Every proof is freshly randomized

Groth16 proofs include two random blinding scalars. Every ZeroJ prove call draws them from
`SecureRandom`, and nothing lets you fix, seed, or omit them. That's what makes the proof
zero-knowledge: an unblinded proof is a deterministic function of the key and the witness, and a
low-entropy secret could be recovered by trying candidates. Consequences:

- Two proofs of the same statement are different bytes. Don't compare proofs for equality.
- There is **no deterministic or unblinded prove** in any published ZeroJ artifact. To debug,
  keep the proof you got.

## Export and hand off proofs

Proofs and keys travel as snarkjs-compatible JSON. The exporters in `org.zeroj.crypto.snarkjs`
write exactly what snarkjs 0.7.6 writes, and refuse non-canonical input (points at infinity,
off-curve points, out-of-range scalars):

```java
BigInteger[] publicInputs = Arrays.copyOfRange(witness, 1, 1 + r1cs.numPublicInputs());

String vkJson = SnarkjsGroth16Json.verificationKeyJson(keys);          // also accepts a SetupResult
String proofJson = SnarkjsGroth16Json.proofJson(proof);
String publicJson = SnarkjsGroth16Json.publicJson(publicInputs);
```

From there:

- **Off-chain:** wrap the JSON in an envelope with `SnarkjsJsonCodec.toEnvelopeFromJson(...)` (or
  the generated `proofEnvelopeBuilder(...)` for annotated circuits) and verify with
  `Groth16BLS12381PureJavaVerifier`. See [Verify off-chain](https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/off-chain/).
- **With snarkjs:** `snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json`.
- **On-chain:** `ProverToCardano.compressVk(keys)` and `ProverToCardano.compressProof(proof)`
  (in `zeroj-onchain-julc`) produce the compressed points a Plutus V3 validator consumes. See
  [Verify on-chain](https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/on-chain/).

> **Danger: A valid proof is not authorization**
>
> A reusable verifier such as the on-chain `Groth16BLS12381Verifier` validator (in
> `zeroj-onchain-julc`) only checks the math. Anyone who sees a proof can resubmit it. Real validators must bind the proof to the transaction's `ScriptContext`,
> prevent replay (for example by binding a public input to the spent UTxO, or with nullifiers), and
> enforce authorization and business rules. See
> [Application security](https://zeroj.dev/guides/verifying/application-security/).

## The expert layer

`Groth16Keys` and `Groth16Pipeline` delegate to public lower-level seams. You rarely need them,
but they exist for memory-tuned pipelines:

| Entry point | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `Groth16SetupBLS381.setup(...)` / `setupToStore(...)` | In-heap and streaming setup (dev only) |
| `Groth16PkStore.load/save` | The key-store format itself |
| `Groth16ProverBLS381.computeHFlat(...)` + `proveWithHCoeffs(...)` | Compute H, drop the constraints, then run the MSMs |
| `Groth16ProverBLS381.proveWithReaders(...)` | Prove from key readers without the handle |
