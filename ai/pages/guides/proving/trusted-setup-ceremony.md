# Run a trusted setup ceremony

> Run a multi-party Groth16 ceremony with snarkjs and the zeroj-ceremony tool, import the result into ZeroJ, and know what to check before trusting one.

Canonical URL: https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/trusted-setup-ceremony/

Every Groth16 circuit needs a trusted setup, and whoever knows the setup's secret randomness (the
"toxic waste") can forge proofs. A **multi-party computation (MPC) ceremony** spreads that
randomness across many independent contributors. The result is sound as long as **at least one**
contributor was honest and destroyed their secret. This page walks through a ceremony with
snarkjs and ZeroJ's `zeroj-ceremony` tool, from circuit freeze to proving with the final key.

New to the idea? Read [Trusted setup, explained](https://zeroj.dev/learn/trusted-setup/) first.

## When you need one

You need a ceremony for **any real deployment of a Groth16 circuit**: anything beyond local
development, tests, and throwaway demos. ZeroJ's in-process setup (`Groth16Keys.setupInMemory`,
`setupToStore`, `Groth16SetupBLS381.setup`) is single-party by design and only runs behind the
`zeroj.allowInsecureTrustedSetup` opt-in.

> **Danger: Never protect value with a development key**
>
> A single-party setup knows the toxic waste. Anyone with access to that process, its memory, or
> its logs could forge proofs for your circuit. Keys that guard anything real must come from a
> ceremony whose transcript you've verified.

## How the pieces fit

```text
Phase 1 (universal, reusable)   powers of tau (.ptau) for BLS12-381, up to 2^N constraints
                                  │  verify, then "prepare phase2"
Phase 2 (one per circuit)       circuit.r1cs ──snarkjs groth16 setup──▶ key_0000.zkey
                                  │  contributor 1, 2, 3 ... (zeroj-ceremony or snarkjs, any mix)
                                  │  public random beacon
                                  ▼
                                key_final.zkey ──snarkjs zkey verify──▶ transcript checked
                                  │
ZeroJ                           zeroj-ceremony finalize ──▶ proving-key store ──▶ prove
```

Every artifact stays in the snarkjs `.zkey` format, and **the independent check is always
`snarkjs zkey verify`**, which re-checks every contribution, including ones made with ZeroJ's
tool. The tool that checks the ceremony is never the tool ZeroJ wrote.

## Before you start: freeze the circuit

A ceremony binds to one exact R1CS. Any later change (a gadget, an array size, the order of
public inputs, a compiler change that alters the constraint shape) needs a new ceremony. Before
starting:

- Finalize and review the circuit, including invalid-witness tests
  ([Test your circuits](https://zeroj.dev/guides/circuits/testing-circuits/)).
- Add the public inputs your validator will use for replay binding. You can't add them later.
- Tag the source commit and record the compiler's constraint count.

You can rehearse the machinery on a throwaway circuit at any time (see
[Rehearse first](#rehearse-first)).

## Phase 1: the powers of tau

Phase 1 is universal: one prepared `.ptau` serves every circuit up to its size, on the same
curve. It must be **BLS12-381**. Two options:

**Reuse an attested ceremony.** ZeroJ's runbook points to Filecoin's BLS12-381 powers of tau
(2²⁷). Whatever the source, verify it and prepare it yourself:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau verify pot_imported.ptau
snarkjs powersoftau truncate pot_imported.ptau
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot25.ptau pot25_final.ptau
```

**Run your own.** Contributors take turns, then a beacon closes it:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau new bls12-381 25 pot_0000.ptau
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot_0000.ptau pot_0001.ptau --name="<who>" -v
# ... more contributors ...
snarkjs powersoftau beacon pot_<last>.ptau pot_beacon.ptau <beaconHash> 10 -n="final beacon"
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot_beacon.ptau pot25_final.ptau
```

At 2²⁵ these steps are heavy (the runbook budgets hours per phase-1 contribution and far longer
for `prepare phase2`), but you do them once. Publish the prepared file and its verify output.

## Phase 2: key genesis (coordinator)

Export your frozen circuit's R1CS with the ZeroJ tool, create the initial key with snarkjs, and
publish both hashes **before** contributions begin:

```bash
zeroj-ceremony export-r1cs \
  --circuit com.example.OwnershipProof \
  --circuit-jar my-circuits.jar \
  --out ownership.r1cs

snarkjs groth16 setup ownership.r1cs pot25_final.ptau key_0000.zkey
shasum -a 256 ownership.r1cs key_0000.zkey
```

`--circuit` takes the `@ZKCircuit` class or its generated `*Circuit` companion (any class with a
static `build()` that returns a `CircuitBuilder`). `export-r1cs` compiles for BLS12-381 and loads
the class reflectively, so run it with the fat jar on a JVM rather than the native binary. From
code, `R1CSSerializer.serialize(r1cs)` produces the same iden3 `.r1cs` bytes.

## Contributors

Contributors need the `zeroj-ceremony` tool (or snarkjs; both produce compatible contributions).

**Get the tool.** When a ZeroJ release publishes the ceremony distributables, they're attached to
the [GitHub release](https://github.com/bloxbean/zeroj/releases): a fat jar
(`zeroj-ceremony-<version>-all.jar`, needs Java 25) and native zips for linux-x86_64, linux-arm64,
macos-arm64, and windows-x86_64 (no Java needed). Or build it from a ZeroJ checkout:

```bash
./gradlew :zeroj-tools:fatJar          # zeroj-tools/build/libs/zeroj-ceremony-<v>-all.jar
./gradlew :zeroj-tools:nativeDistZip   # needs a GraalVM JDK; zeroj-tools/build/distributions/
```

**Contribute.** Check what you received against the coordinator's published hash, contribute, and
send the result back:

```bash
shasum -a 256 key_0007.zkey                      # must match the published hash
zeroj-ceremony contribute --in key_0007.zkey --out key_0008.zkey --name "Alice / Example Org"
shasum -a 256 key_0008.zkey
```

| Option | Required | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `--in <file>` | yes | The `.zkey` you received |
| `--out <file>` | yes | The `.zkey` you send back |
| `--name <text>` | no | Your name in the public transcript (default `zeroj contributor`) |

The tool draws your secret from the OS secure random source, uses it once, and never writes it
anywhere. It prints a **Contribution Hash**; copy it into your attestation. The equivalent snarkjs
command is `snarkjs zkey contribute key_0007.zkey key_0008.zkey --name="..."`. ZeroJ's
documentation reports its contributor at roughly 0.9 hours versus 2.5 to 3 hours for snarkjs on a
19M-constraint key (about 30 GB); budget about twice the `.zkey` size in free disk.

**Publish an attestation**, for example as a gist or a pull request to the ceremony's transcript
repository:

```text
Ceremony: <circuit name>, contribution #8
Who: <name/org>, <date>
Received: key_0007.zkey   sha256=<...>
Produced: key_0008.zkey   sha256=<...>
Contribution Hash: <as printed by the tool>
Machine: <e.g. personal laptop, offline>
I confirm the entropy was generated fresh and destroyed after use.
```

After contributing there's nothing left to keep secret. What matters is that nobody observed the
machine during the contribution.

To embed contributions in your own service or wallet, `zeroj-tools` exposes the same step as a
library call: `ZkeyContributor.contribute(in, out, name)` returns the contribution hash.

## Close the ceremony (coordinator)

```bash
# 1. Beacon: announce the source BEFORE the last contribution lands,
#    e.g. "the hash of Bitcoin block N" or "drand round R" for a future N or R
snarkjs zkey beacon key_0012.zkey key_final.zkey <beaconHashHex> 10 -n="final beacon"

# 2. The independent check anyone can re-run
snarkjs zkey verify ownership.r1cs pot25_final.ptau key_final.zkey

# 3. The verification key for your verifiers and validators
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey key_final.zkey verification_key.json

# 4. Convert to a ZeroJ proving-key store (streaming, multi-GB safe)
zeroj-ceremony finalize --zkey key_final.zkey --pk-store ./ownership-pk
```

`finalize` is `ZkeyPkStoreImporter.importToPkStore(...)` behind a CLI, and you can call that
method directly instead. The importer validates the key's curve, field, and dimensions, and that
every verification-key point is on the curve and not the point at infinity.

## Prove with the ceremony key

The imported store works like any other key bundle. Remember that snarkjs appends one binding row
per public input (plus one for the constant wire), so pass them to the prover:

```java
int numPublic = r1cs.numPublicInputs();
try (var keys = Groth16Keys.load(Path.of("ownership-pk"))) {
    var proof = keys.prove(witness,
            ZkeyPkStoreImporter.snarkjsConstraints(r1cs.constraints(), numPublic));
}
```

For the packed path and `Groth16Pipeline`, pass `numPublic + 1` as the binding-row count. See
[Prove with Groth16](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/groth16/#flow-3-keys-from-a-ceremony). Before going live,
generate a test proof and verify it off-chain and on-chain against the exported verification key.

## Pin artifact hashes

Treat the ceremony outputs as pinned artifacts, and check their hashes where you load them:

- Record the SHA-256 of `ownership.r1cs`, `key_final.zkey`, `verification_key.json`, and the
  prepared `.ptau` in your repository or release notes.
- The in-memory importers accept an expected hash and refuse a mismatch before parsing:
  `ZkeyImporterBLS381.importZkeyFull(bytes, expectedSha256)` (keys up to 128 MB) and
  `PtauImporterBLS381.importPtau(input, maxPoints, expectedSha256)`.
- `ZkeyPkStoreImporter.importToPkStore` has no hash parameter, so check the file's SHA-256
  yourself before importing it.
- Pin the verification key your on-chain validator is built with, and treat any change as a new
  deployment.

## Publish the transcript

In a public repository, publish:

- the `.r1cs`, its hash, and the exact circuit source commit it was built from
- the prepared `.ptau` source, hash, and verify output
- every intermediate `.zkey` hash and every contributor attestation
- the beacon announcement and the beacon value
- the `snarkjs zkey verify` output and the final key and verification-key hashes

Coordinator checklist, from ZeroJ's runbook:

- [ ] Circuit frozen (reviewed, replay-binding public inputs added) and tagged in git
- [ ] Prepared `.ptau` acquired, and its verify output published
- [ ] `.r1cs` and `key_0000.zkey` hashes published before contributions
- [ ] At least 3 contributors from independent organizations, attestations published
- [ ] Beacon source announced in advance, applied, and published
- [ ] `zkey verify` passes; final key and verification-key hashes published
- [ ] `finalize` run; a test proof verified off-chain and on-chain

## What to check before trusting a ceremony

If you're a user or auditor of someone else's deployment, you don't have to trust the coordinator.
Check:

1. **The circuit.** Rebuild the `.r1cs` from the published source commit and compare hashes, so
   you know the key binds to the circuit you reviewed.
2. **The transcript.** Run `snarkjs zkey verify <circuit.r1cs> <prepared.ptau> <key_final.zkey>`
   yourself.
3. **The contributors.** Several independent, identifiable people or organizations, each with a
   published attestation whose hashes chain from one key to the next.
4. **The beacon.** It was announced before the last contribution and matches the public value.
5. **The deployed key.** The verification key in the validator or service matches the one
   exported from the verified final key.

If any link is missing, treat the setup as untrusted.

## Rehearse first

ZeroJ ships a rehearsal script that runs this whole flow on a tiny circuit, mixing ZeroJ and
snarkjs contributions, a beacon, `zkey verify`, and `finalize`:
[`docs/ceremony/rehearsal.sh`](https://github.com/bloxbean/zeroj/blob/main/docs/ceremony/rehearsal.sh).
It needs snarkjs on your `PATH`, Java 25, and a built ZeroJ checkout.
