# Prove you're over 18

> Build a range proof with ZkUInt, see why bit widths matter, test an invalid witness, and verify with nothing but a key, a proof and public inputs.

Canonical URL: https://zeroj.dev/tutorials/age-check/

A website wants to know you're an adult. Today you'd show an ID card and hand over your name,
birth date and address to answer a yes/no question. In this tutorial you'll answer only the
question: you prove *"my age is at least 18"* while your age stays on your machine.

**What you'll build:** an `AgeCheck` circuit, a prover that sets up keys once and reuses them,
and a separate `AgeVerifier` that holds only a verification key and its own policy.

**What you'll learn:**

- how `ZkUInt` and `@UInt(bits = ...)` make comparisons safe in a finite field
- what happens when the witness is invalid, and why constraints, not your Java code, are the
  real gatekeeper
- how public inputs are ordered, and why a verifier should build them itself
- how to persist keys so setup runs once
- what an age proof does *not* prove on its own

**Note: Prerequisites:** 

Java 25 and Gradle (see [Installation](https://zeroj.dev/start/installation/)). The
[Quickstart](https://zeroj.dev/start/quickstart/) introduces the basic flow; this page is self-contained, but it
moves faster.

## Build it

1. **Create the project.**

   

   - zeroj-age-check/
     - settings.gradle
     - build.gradle
     - src/main/java/com/example/agecheck/
       - AgeCheck.java
       - AgeVerifier.java
       - Main.java

   

   ```groovy title="settings.gradle"
   rootProject.name = 'zeroj-age-check'
   ```

   ```groovy title="build.gradle"
   plugins {
       id 'application'
   }

   repositories {
       mavenCentral()
   }

   java {
       toolchain {
           languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(25)
       }
   }

   dependencies {
       implementation platform('org.zeroj:zeroj-bom-core:0.1.0-pre12')
       annotationProcessor platform('org.zeroj:zeroj-bom-core:0.1.0-pre12')

       implementation 'org.zeroj:zeroj-circuit-annotation-api'
       annotationProcessor 'org.zeroj:zeroj-circuit-annotation-processor'
       implementation 'org.zeroj:zeroj-circuit-dsl'
       implementation 'org.zeroj:zeroj-crypto'
       implementation 'org.zeroj:zeroj-codec'
       implementation 'org.zeroj:zeroj-verifier-groth16'
   }

   application {
       mainClass = 'com.example.agecheck.Main'
       // Dev-only: allows the in-process, single-party trusted setup.
       applicationDefaultJvmArgs = ['-Dzeroj.allowInsecureTrustedSetup=true']
   }
   ```

2. **Write the circuit.** The age is secret, the threshold is public, and both are 8-bit
   unsigned integers.

   ```java title="src/main/java/com/example/agecheck/AgeCheck.java"
   package com.example.agecheck;

   import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.Prove;
   import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.Public;
   import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.Secret;
   import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.UInt;
   import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.ZKCircuit;
   import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.ZkBool;
   import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.ZkUInt;

   /** "My secret age is at least the public threshold." */
   @ZKCircuit(name = "age-check", version = 1)
   public class AgeCheck {

       @Prove
       ZkBool prove(@Public @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt threshold,
                    @Secret @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt age) {
           return age.gte(threshold);
       }
   }
   ```

   `@UInt(bits = 8)` isn't decoration. It adds constraints proving each value fits in 8 bits
   (0 to 255), and `gte` relies on that. The section after the steps explains why.

3. **Write the verifier.** This class is what a website would run. It holds a trusted
   verification key and a policy, receives a proof plus public inputs, and never sees an age.

   ```java title="src/main/java/com/example/agecheck/AgeVerifier.java"
   package com.example.agecheck;

   import org.zeroj.api.CurveId;
   import org.zeroj.api.ProofSystemId;
   import org.zeroj.api.PublicInputs;
   import org.zeroj.api.VerificationMaterial;
   import org.zeroj.codec.SnarkjsJsonCodec;
   import org.zeroj.verifier.groth16.bls12381.Groth16BLS12381PureJavaVerifier;

   import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

   /**
    * The verifier's side. It holds a trusted verification key and its own policy
    * ("adults only: threshold = 18"). It receives a proof and public inputs from
    * the prover — and never sees the age.
    */
   public class AgeVerifier {

       private static final int REQUIRED_AGE = 18;

       private final String trustedVkJson;

       public AgeVerifier(String trustedVkJson) {
           this.trustedVkJson = trustedVkJson;
       }

       public boolean accept(String proofJson, String publicJson) {
           // 1. Policy: the statement must be "age >= 18", not a threshold the prover picked.
           PublicInputs expected = AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().threshold(REQUIRED_AGE).toPublicInputs();
           PublicInputs claimed = SnarkjsJsonCodec.parsePublicInputs(publicJson);
           if (!expected.equals(claimed)) {
               System.out.println("  rejected: statement " + claimed.values()
                       + " is not the required " + expected.values());
               return false;
           }

           // 2. Math: is the proof valid for this VK and these public inputs?
           var circuitId = AgeCheckCircuit.circuitId();
           var envelope = SnarkjsJsonCodec.toEnvelopeFromJson(proofJson, trustedVkJson, publicJson, circuitId);
           var material = VerificationMaterial.of(trustedVkJson.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8),
                   ProofSystemId.GROTH16, CurveId.BLS12_381, circuitId);
           var result = new Groth16BLS12381PureJavaVerifier().verify(envelope, material);
           if (!result.proofValid()) {
               System.out.println("  rejected: " + result.message().orElse("invalid proof"));
           }
           return result.proofValid();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Write the prover program.** It runs setup once and saves the keys, then plays three
   characters: an adult, a 16-year-old, and a 17-year-old who proves something true but
   useless.

   ```java title="src/main/java/com/example/agecheck/Main.java"
   package com.example.agecheck;

   import org.zeroj.api.CurveId;
   import org.zeroj.crypto.groth16.Groth16Keys;
   import org.zeroj.crypto.groth16.Groth16PkStore;
   import org.zeroj.crypto.setup.PowersOfTauBLS381;
   import org.zeroj.crypto.snarkjs.SnarkjsGroth16Json;

   import java.io.IOException;
   import java.math.BigInteger;
   import java.nio.file.Files;
   import java.nio.file.Path;
   import java.util.Arrays;

   public class Main {

       static final Path KEY_DIR = Path.of("build/age-check-keys");
       static final Path VK_FILE = Path.of("build/age-check-vk.json");

       public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
           var circuit = AgeCheckCircuit.build();
           var r1cs = circuit.compileR1CS(CurveId.BLS12_381);
           System.out.println("Public inputs, in order: "
                   + AgeCheckCircuit.schema().publicInputs().names());
           System.out.println("Constraints: " + r1cs.numConstraints());

           // --- One-time setup (DEV-ONLY), then reuse the keys on every later run ---------------
           if (!Groth16PkStore.exists(KEY_DIR)) {
               BigInteger tau = PowersOfTauBLS381.generate(6).tauScalar();
               try (var keys = Groth16Keys.setupToStore(r1cs.flat(), r1cs.numWires(),
                       r1cs.numPublicInputs(), tau, KEY_DIR, true)) {
                   Files.writeString(VK_FILE, SnarkjsGroth16Json.verificationKeyJson(keys));
               }
               System.out.println("Setup done; keys saved to " + KEY_DIR);
           }

           var verifier = new AgeVerifier(Files.readString(VK_FILE));

           try (var keys = Groth16Keys.load(KEY_DIR)) {
               // --- Prover: a 25-year-old proves "age >= 18" ------------------------------------
               var inputs = AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().age(25).threshold(18);
               BigInteger[] witness = inputs.calculateWitness(circuit, CurveId.BLS12_381);
               var proof = keys.prove(witness, r1cs.constraints());
               String proofJson = SnarkjsGroth16Json.proofJson(proof);
               String publicJson = SnarkjsGroth16Json.publicJson(
                       inputs.publicValues().toArray(BigInteger[]::new));
               System.out.println("Public inputs sent to the verifier: " + inputs.publicValues());
               System.out.println("Adult accepted? " + verifier.accept(proofJson, publicJson));

               // --- A 16-year-old cannot even build a witness ------------------------------------
               try {
                   AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().age(16).threshold(18)
                           .calculateWitness(circuit, CurveId.BLS12_381);
                   System.out.println("16-year-old produced a witness?!");
               } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                   System.out.println("16-year-old: witness rejected (" + e.getMessage() + ")");
               }

               // --- A true statement about the wrong threshold is still rejected ----------------
               var teen = AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().age(17).threshold(16);
               var teenProof = keys.prove(teen.calculateWitness(circuit, CurveId.BLS12_381),
                       r1cs.constraints());
               String teenPublic = SnarkjsGroth16Json.publicJson(
                       teen.publicValues().toArray(BigInteger[]::new));
               System.out.println("Proof of 'age >= 16' accepted? "
                       + verifier.accept(SnarkjsGroth16Json.proofJson(teenProof), teenPublic));
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Run it** with `gradle run` (or `./gradlew run`). The first run does the setup:

   ```text
   Public inputs, in order: [threshold]
   Constraints: 54
   WARNING: Single-party Powers of Tau generation (BLS12-381) — for DEVELOPMENT and TESTING only. Use MPC ceremony outputs (Hermez, Zcash PoT) for production.
   WARNING: Single-party Groth16 Phase 2 setup (BLS12-381, streaming) — for DEVELOPMENT and TESTING only. Use snarkjs multi-party ceremony for production.
   Setup done; keys saved to build/age-check-keys
   Public inputs sent to the verifier: [18]
   Adult accepted? true
   16-year-old: witness rejected (Constraint violation: w112=0 != w113=1)
     rejected: statement [16] is not the required [18]
   Proof of 'age >= 16' accepted? false
   ```

   Run it again: the `WARNING` and `Setup done` lines disappear, because the keys are loaded
   from `build/age-check-keys`.

## Why `@UInt(bits = 8)` matters

Circuits don't compute with Java `int`s. Every value is an element of a *finite field*: the
integers modulo a large prime `r` (for BLS12-381, `r` is a 255-bit number). Arithmetic wraps
around at `r`, so there are no negative numbers and no natural "less than":

```text
16 - 18  =  r - 2  =  52435875175126190479447740508185965837690552500527637822603658699938581184511
```

That's why `ZkField` has no `gte` method at all. To compare, a circuit has to prove that both
values are small, which it does by splitting them into bits and checking each bit is 0 or 1.
`@UInt(bits = 8)` adds exactly those constraints when the input is created. After that, `gte`
can compare two numbers known to lie in 0 to 255, where "greater or equal" means what you
expect.

You can watch the wrap-around get caught. In the [Try this](#try-this) variant below, a
birth year *after* the current year makes `currentYear.sub(birthYear)` wrap to a huge number,
and the 16-bit range check rejects it:

```text
ArithmeticException: Constraint violation: w234=65533 != w169=52435875175126190479447740508185965837690552500527637822603658699938581184509
```

That long number is `2026 − 2030` in the field, which is `r − 4`.

## The invalid witness, and who really enforces the rule

For the 16-year-old, `calculateWitness` throws `ArithmeticException: Constraint violation`
before any proof exists. It's useful, but it isn't a security boundary: the witness calculator
is ordinary Java running on the prover's own machine, and a cheater can skip it and hand-craft
a witness.

What stops the cheater is the constraints. Groth16 is designed so that a proof verifies only
if *every* constraint holds (assuming nobody kept the setup's toxic waste). We tried it: take
the adult's valid witness, overwrite the age with 16 (element `2`, right after the constant `1`
and the public `threshold`), prove anyway, and the verifier answers
`Groth16 BLS12-381 pairing check failed`.

That's why an honest run proves nothing about soundness. A circuit that forgets a constraint
still works perfectly for honest users. Always test inputs that must fail, like this page
does. [Testing circuits](https://zeroj.dev/guides/circuits/testing-circuits/) goes deeper.

_The web version of this page has an interactive illustration here._

## Public inputs: order and ownership

Groth16 public inputs are a plain list of numbers, and order matters. The generated schema
fixes it: public inputs come in declaration order, which you can print with
`AgeCheckCircuit.schema().publicInputs().names()`. The generated `Inputs` class gives you the
values in that order through `publicValues()` (a `List<BigInteger>`) or `toPublicInputs()` (a
typed `PublicInputs`).

Notice where the verifier gets its public inputs from. It *builds* the expected list from its
own policy with `AgeCheckCircuit.inputs().threshold(18).toPublicInputs()` and compares it
with what the prover sent. The third scenario shows why: the 17-year-old's proof of
`age >= 16` is perfectly valid, because the statement is true. A verifier that only asked "is
this proof valid?" would have let them in.

## Reusing keys

Setup is the slow, sensitive part, so you do it once per circuit:

- `Groth16Keys.setupToStore(...)` streams the proving key into a directory
  (`sparse = true` stores it compactly), and `Groth16Keys.load(dir)` memory-maps it on later
  runs. Small circuits can also use `setupInMemory`, as the Quickstart does.
- The verification key is tiny and public. The prover program writes it to
  `build/age-check-vk.json`, and the verifier only ever reads that file.
- Keys belong to one exact circuit. Change the circuit and you must delete
  `build/age-check-keys` and run setup again. (`gradle clean` also deletes it.)

> **Caution: Development setup only**
>
> These keys come from a single-party setup that knows its toxic waste, which is why it needs
> `-Dzeroj.allowInsecureTrustedSetup=true`. Anyone with that secret can forge an "I'm over 18"
> proof. Production keys come from a multi-party ceremony; see
> [Running a trusted setup ceremony](https://zeroj.dev/guides/proving/trusted-setup-ceremony/).

## What this proof does not prove

The circuit proves that the prover knows *a* number of at least 18. It doesn't prove that the
number is *their age*. Right now anyone can type `.age(25)` and pass.

To make an age check meaningful, the age has to come from someone the verifier trusts, such
as a government or a KYC provider. Typically the issuer signs or commits to the user's
attributes, and the circuit proves the age inside that signed credential is at least 18.
Alternatively, BBS credentials let the holder reveal selected attributes of a signed
credential directly. See [Age & KYC checks](https://zeroj.dev/use-cases/age-and-kyc/) and
[BBS credentials](https://zeroj.dev/guides/credentials/bbs/).

## Try this

Add a version that works from a birth year, so the verifier supplies the current year:

```java title="src/main/java/com/example/agecheck/BirthYearCheck.java"
package com.example.agecheck;

import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.Prove;
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.Public;
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.Secret;
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.UInt;
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.ZKCircuit;
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.ZkBool;
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.ZkUInt;

@ZKCircuit(name = "birth-year-check", version = 1)
public class BirthYearCheck {

    @Prove
    ZkBool prove(@Public @UInt(bits = 16) ZkUInt currentYear,
                 @Public @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt minAge,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 16) ZkUInt birthYear) {
        ZkUInt age = currentYear.sub(birthYear); // range-checked: can't wrap below zero
        return age.gte(minAge);
    }
}
```

Build witnesses with `BirthYearCheckCircuit.inputs().currentYear(2026).minAge(18).birthYear(...)`.
A birth year of 2000 works, 2010 fails the comparison, and 2030 fails the range check shown
above. `ZkUInt.sub` range-checks its result at the wider of the two widths, which is what
catches the wrap. (Counting whole years is only approximate; a real service would compare
full dates.)
