ZeroJ implements three cryptographic systems. Two of them, Groth16 and PlonK, prove statements
about circuits. The third, BBS, is a signature scheme for credentials. They solve different
problems, and in ZeroJ they have very different maturity. This page explains each one, compares
them side by side, and explains why everything runs on the BLS12-381 curve.

**Short version:** use **Groth16 on BLS12-381** for circuits. It's the focus of the current
release and the default throughout these docs. Use **BBS** when you need issuer-signed credentials
with selective disclosure. Treat ZeroJ's **PlonK** support as experimental.

## Groth16: the default

Groth16 (Jens Groth, 2016) is the most widely deployed zk-SNARK. It turns an R1CS circuit into
proofs that are tiny and cheap to verify.

- **Proof:** three elliptic-curve points: two in the group G1 and one in G2. On BLS12-381 that's
  48 + 96 + 48 = **192 bytes** in compressed form, whatever the size of the circuit. (The same proof
  as snarkjs-style JSON text is about 1 KB.)
- **Verification:** a single *pairing check*, plus one elliptic-curve multiplication per public
  input. On Cardano, ZeroJ's reusable verifier does four Miller loops and one final check using
  Plutus V3 builtins. In ZeroJ's JuLC VM tests, a proof with two public inputs used about
  2.8 billion CPU units, against a per-transaction limit of 10 billion.
- **Setup:** Groth16 needs a **trusted setup for each circuit**. A universal "powers of tau"
  phase is reused, and a circuit-specific phase 2 runs for every circuit and every change to it.
  See [Trusted setup, explained](/learn/trusted-setup/).

The per-circuit setup is Groth16's main cost. In exchange you get the smallest proofs and the
cheapest verification of the three, which is exactly what you want when a blockchain validator
pays for every CPU cycle.

In ZeroJ, Groth16 on BLS12-381 is **Beta** off-chain and **Beta, testnet only** on-chain. You get
a pure-Java prover, a pure-Java verifier, a reusable Plutus V3 verifier, import of snarkjs `.zkey`
ceremony keys, and export to snarkjs-compatible JSON.

## PlonK: universal setup (experimental in ZeroJ)

PlonK (Gabizon, Williamson, and Ciobotaru, 2019) uses a different circuit format, built from
gates and wiring permutations instead of R1CS, and a polynomial commitment scheme called
**KZG**.

- **Setup:** one **universal** trusted setup (a KZG structured reference string, or SRS) serves
  every circuit up to a maximum size. Each circuit still needs preprocessing, but that step is
  public and deterministic, so changing a circuit doesn't need a new ceremony.
- **Proof:** larger than Groth16, about 650 bytes (roughly 3.5 times as large).
- **Verification:** two pairings plus more scalar multiplications than Groth16. ZeroJ's
  experimental on-chain verifier measured about 4.8 billion CPU units for one public input.
- **Non-interactivity** comes from Fiat–Shamir: the verifier's challenges are derived by hashing
  the proof transcript, so transcript encoding details are security-critical.

:::caution[PlonK is experimental in ZeroJ]
ZeroJ includes pure-Java PlonK proving and verification and experimental on-chain validators.
All of it is **experimental**, off-chain and on-chain. These docs make no correctness or
readiness claims for it, and it isn't a recommended alternative to Groth16. Use it only for
evaluation and research. See [PlonK](/guides/proving/plonk/) and [Status & maturity](/start/status/).

## BBS: signatures with selective disclosure

BBS works differently from the other two. It isn't a circuit proof system; it's a **signature
scheme** with a built-in zero-knowledge proof. The workflow has three parties:

```text
 Issuer                     Holder                              Verifier
   │  signs attributes        │                                    │
   │  [name, birth date,      │                                    │
   │   country, KYC level, …] │                                    │
   ├─────── signature ───────►│                                    │
   │                          │  derives a proof revealing only    │
   │                          │  [country, KYC level]              │
   │                          ├──────── presentation ─────────────►│
   │                          │                                    │  checks against the
   │                          │                                    │  issuer's public key
```

- The **issuer** signs a list of messages (attributes) with one signature.
- The **holder** derives a *presentation*: a zero-knowledge proof that they hold a valid
  signature over all the attributes, revealing only the ones they choose.
- The **verifier** checks the presentation against the issuer's public key. Hidden attributes stay
  hidden, and each presentation is freshly randomized, so two presentations of the same
  credential aren't linkable by their bytes.

**No trusted setup.** The issuer just generates a key pair.

**Proof size** grows with what you hide: a presentation proof is 272 bytes plus 32 bytes per
hidden attribute.

**Limitation:** BBS can reveal or hide attributes, but it can't prove a *predicate* about a hidden
attribute, such as "birth date is before 2007". For predicates, use a circuit (Groth16), possibly
alongside BBS.

ZeroJ implements the IRTF CFRG draft `draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-10` with both of its
BLS12-381 ciphersuites (SHA-256 and SHAKE-256), and tests against the draft's official fixtures.
The draft isn't an RFC yet, so the scheme itself may still change. In ZeroJ, BBS verification is
**Beta**, and issuance and proof generation are **Beta with a caveat**: the default pure-Java
provider isn't constant-time, so prefer the blst provider for issuer keys. There is also a
fixed-profile on-chain presentation verifier. See [BBS credentials](/guides/credentials/bbs/).

## Side by side

| | Groth16 | PlonK | BBS |
|---|---------|-------|-----|
| What it proves | Any statement you express as an R1CS circuit | Any statement you express as a PlonK circuit | "I hold an issuer-signed credential; here are the attributes I choose to reveal" |
| Setup | Trusted, **per circuit** (universal phase 1 + circuit-specific phase 2) | Trusted, **universal** SRS, reused across circuits | **None** beyond the issuer's key pair |
| Proof size (BLS12-381) | 192 bytes | about 650 bytes | 272 bytes + 32 per hidden attribute |
| Verification cost | Lowest: one pairing check + one scalar multiplication per public input | Higher: two pairings + more scalar multiplications | Pairing-based; grows with the number of attributes |
| Changing the circuit | New phase-2 ceremony | Recompute public preprocessing | Not applicable |
| Status in ZeroJ | **Beta** off-chain; **Beta, testnet only** on-chain | **Experimental**, off-chain and on-chain | Verification **Beta**; issuance **Beta with caveat**; on-chain verifier is fixed-profile |
| When to use | **Default** for every circuit, especially on Cardano | Evaluation and research only | Credentials with selective disclosure |

## Why BLS12-381 and not BN254?

Pairing-based proof systems need a **pairing-friendly elliptic curve**. Two curves dominate the
ecosystem:

- **BN254** (also called alt_bn128) is what Ethereum's precompiles support, so much existing
  tooling, including default circom and snarkjs setups, targets it.
- **BLS12-381** was designed later with a higher security margin. It's used by Zcash, Ethereum's
  consensus layer, and many signature schemes.

For Cardano the choice is simple. Plutus V3, introduced in the Conway era, added **native
BLS12-381 builtins**, specified in CIP-0381: curve point operations, Miller loops, and a final
pairing check. There are no BN254 builtins, so a BN254 proof can't be verified on-chain at any
reasonable cost.

That's why ZeroJ uses BLS12-381 everywhere by default. Circuits compile over the BLS12-381 scalar
field (`CurveId.BLS12_381`), and hash gadgets must use BLS12-381 parameters, such as Poseidon with
`PoseidonParamsBLS12_381T3.INSTANCE`. ZeroJ still contains legacy BN254 code, but it's **disabled
by default** and needs `-Dzeroj.allowLegacyBn254=true`. Use it only for off-chain experiments.

:::note[Bringing circom circuits]
circom and snarkjs default to BN254. To use a circom circuit with ZeroJ and Cardano, compile and
set it up for BLS12-381 (for example, `circom circuit.circom --r1cs --wasm -p bls12381`). See
[Bring circom & snarkjs circuits](/tutorials/snarkjs-interop/).

## Which should I use?

- **Proving a statement about private data?** Groth16 on BLS12-381. Plan for a proper ceremony
  before anything real depends on it.
- **Issuing credentials that holders reveal piece by piece?** BBS.
- **Need a predicate over a credential attribute?** A Groth16 circuit, possibly combined with BBS
  or another way of binding the attribute to an issuer.
- **Curious about universal setups?** Try PlonK for research, and keep it away from anything that
  matters.
