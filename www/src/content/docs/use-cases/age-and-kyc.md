Regulated DeFi, age-gated content and jurisdiction checks all ask the same thing: *are you allowed
to use this?* Today the answer usually means uploading a passport to every app, which stores it and
can leak it. Credentials fix half of that problem. A KYC provider checks you once and signs your
attributes. Zero knowledge fixes the other half: you prove the signed attributes satisfy the rule,
and the app never sees them.

## The zero-knowledge idea

**The holder proves "a registered issuer signed my age and country, my age meets the minimum, and my
country is on the approved list". The only public outputs are the issuer's key, the policy and the
result.**

The issuer signs `Poseidon(age, country)` with EdDSA over Jubjub. Jubjub is a curve defined over the
BLS12-381 scalar field, so checking its signatures inside a BLS12-381 circuit is comparatively cheap.
The circuit then does three things:

1. verifies the issuer's signature on the hidden attributes;
2. compares `age ≥ minAge` as 8-bit integers;
3. proves `country` is a leaf of the approved-country Merkle tree, whose root is public.

The demo circuit is about 11,000 constraints. The on-chain check costs the same whatever the circuit
contains, because it's a Groth16 pairing check over a handful of public inputs.

## What stays private, what's public

| Input | Visibility | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `age` | Secret | 8-bit integer, range-checked; only the comparison result matters |
| `country` | Secret | Numeric country code; only membership in the approved set matters |
| Issuer signature (`sigRU`, `sigRV`, `sigS`) and helper witnesses (`kModL`, `kQuotient`) | Secret | Revealing the signature would make every presentation linkable |
| Merkle path (`siblings`, `pathBits`) | Secret | The path would reveal which country |
| `pkU`, `pkV` | Public | The issuer's Jubjub public key; the validator pins it |
| `minAge` | Public | The policy threshold; pinned |
| `countryRoot` | Public | The approved-country set; pinned |
| `eligible` | Public | Proven equal to `age ≥ minAge`; the validator requires 1 |

## How it works

1. **Issue.** The KYC provider verifies the person out of band, signs `Poseidon(age, country)` and
   hands the holder their attributes plus the signature. The issuer keeps its secret key.
2. **Deploy the gate.** The protocol compiles a validator with the verification key, the issuer's
   public key, `minAge` and `countryRoot` as script parameters. Changing the policy produces a new
   script address.
3. **Prove.** The holder generates a Groth16 proof on their own device. The demo does this
   server-side for convenience.
4. **Spend.** The transaction's redeemer carries the proof plus the five public inputs. The
   validator checks the issuer, the policy, `eligible == 1` and the proof.
5. **Reuse.** No nullifier is involved. The same credential can prove eligibility again and again,
   which suits ongoing access.

```text
issuer ──sign(Poseidon(age, country))──▶ holder ──Groth16 proof──▶ validator
  (off-chain, once)                        (local)      params: VK, issuer key, minAge, countryRoot
                                                        checks: registered issuer + policy + eligible==1 + pairing
```

## The circuit

This is lightly simplified from the demo's `CredentialProof`: constructor validation is trimmed and
the steps are reordered for reading.

```java title="CredentialProof.java"
import org.zeroj.circuit.annotation.*;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.poseidon.PoseidonParams;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.poseidon.PoseidonParamsBLS12_381T3;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.zk.ZkEdDSAJubjub;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.zk.ZkMerkle;
import org.zeroj.circuit.lib.zk.ZkPoseidon;

@ZKCircuit(name = "credential-verify-eddsa",
           nameTemplate = "credential-verify-eddsa-d{countryTreeDepth}-bls-poseidon", version = 1)
public class CredentialProof {
    private static final PoseidonParams POSEIDON = PoseidonParamsBLS12_381T3.INSTANCE;

    public CredentialProof(@CircuitParam("countryTreeDepth") int countryTreeDepth) {}

    @Prove
    ZkBool prove(ZkContext zk,
                 @Public ZkField pkU,
                 @Public ZkField pkV,
                 @Public @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt minAge,
                 @Public ZkField countryRoot,
                 @Public ZkBool eligible,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 8) ZkUInt age,
                 @Secret ZkField country,
                 @Secret ZkField sigRU,
                 @Secret ZkField sigRV,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 252) ZkUInt sigS,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 252) ZkUInt kModL,
                 @Secret @UInt(bits = 4) ZkUInt kQuotient,
                 @Secret @FixedSize(param = "countryTreeDepth") ZkArray<ZkField> siblings,
                 @Secret @FixedSize(param = "countryTreeDepth") ZkArray<ZkBool> pathBits) {

        // 1. The issuer signed these exact attributes
        var claims = ZkPoseidon.hash(zk, POSEIDON, age.asField(), country);
        ZkEdDSAJubjub.verifyWithRegisteredKey(zk, pkU, pkV, claims, sigRU, sigRV, sigS, kModL, kQuotient);

        // 2. The country is in the approved set
        ZkMerkle.verifyProofPoseidon(zk, POSEIDON, country, countryRoot, siblings, pathBits);

        // 3. The age meets the minimum
        return eligible.isEqual(age.gte(minAge));
    }
}
```

`verifyWithRegisteredKey` is the right entry point here because the issuer key is a public input
that the verifier pins. If the prover could choose the key, you'd need `verifyStrict`, which also
checks the key's subgroup membership inside the circuit. The name reminds you that "is this a
trusted issuer?" is the validator's job.

:::tip[Sign a birth year, not an age]
An age goes stale the day after it's signed. The
[selective-disclosure demo](/use-cases/selective-disclosure/) signs `dobYear` and proves
`dobYear ≤ currentYear − 21`, with `currentYear` pinned by the validator.

## On Cardano

The demo's `CredentialGatedValidator` is a JuLC spending validator. It composes
`Groth16BLS12381Lib.verify(…)` and takes the verification key, the issuer's key coordinates and the
policy values (`minAge`, `countryRoot`) as parameters. It accepts a spend only if the redeemer's
public inputs match the registered issuer and policy, `eligible == 1`, and the pairing check
passes.

A valid proof is not authorization. This gate is stateless, so the proof isn't tied to the person
spending. Anyone who sees an unlock transaction can copy its proof. In the demo each locked UTxO
can be spent only once, but a real protocol should bind the proof to its context: add the
recipient or the spent `TxOutRef` as a bound public input that the validator recomputes from
`ScriptContext`, or use a per-epoch nullifier when access should be rate-limited. See
[Application security](/guides/verifying/application-security/).

## Security considerations

- **You trust the issuer.** A dishonest or compromised issuer can sign anything. Plan for key
  rotation and revocation: short-lived credentials, or a periodically refreshed validity tree the
  circuit checks.
- **Keep issuance offline.** The demo signs with `EdDSAJubjub.signCompatibilityOffline`. ZeroJ's
  Jubjub signing isn't constant-time and is meant for offline, isolated use. Don't expose it as a
  network signing service.
- **Credentials can be shared.** A proof shows knowledge of a credential, not identity. Holder
  binding helps: include the holder's key in the signed message and prove control of it.
- **Replay** of stateless proofs, as described above.
- **Linkability outside the proof.** The same wallet, fee payer or timing can still link two
  presentations.
- **Trusted setup.** The demo uses a single-party development setup; production needs an MPC
  ceremony ([Trusted setup, explained](/learn/trusted-setup/)).

## Try it

The demo lives in
[`identity-kyc`](https://github.com/bloxbean/zeroj-usecases/tree/main/identity-kyc). With Yaci
DevKit running (see [Run the demos](/use-cases/overview/#run-the-demos)):

```bash
./demo.sh identity-kyc --run
```

`--run` locks 5 ADA at the credential-gated script, proves that Alice (25, USA) is eligible and
unlocks the funds with that proof on-chain. The UI lists five test users. Charlie is 16 and Diana's
country isn't on the approved list, so neither can produce a proof that unlocks the gate.
